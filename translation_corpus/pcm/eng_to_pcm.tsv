It is pointed out, with some justification too, that because this control and dominance work to their advantage, Fulani political aristocracy always works against the attempts by other ethnic groups for the enthronement of a just, equitable and inclusive Nigeria for all.	Dem don point am out, wit som justification too, say sake of say dis kontrol and dominance work to dia advantage, Fulani political aristocracy dey always work against di attempt of oda  ethnic group for di enthronement of a just, equitable and inclusive Nigeria for all.
Although this accusation against the Fulani has been on for years now, at no time has it become more pronounced than in the present time under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari who happens to be a Fulani man.	Even say dis accusation against Fulani don dey for years now, no time wey e dey more pronounced pass dis present time unda di administration of President Muhammadu Buhari wey be Fulani man.
Although some will dismiss this as part of the stuff of politics in Nigeria, the claim that Fulani wield and retain a disproportionate slice of political power to the detriment and exclusion of others is not totally unfounded, nor is it untrue that the Fulani political aristocracy has sought to perpetuate this control through a subtle agenda of exclusive empowerment and appointment into the strategic areas of the countrys polity and economy.	Even say som go troway dis as part of di stuff of politiks for Nigeria, di claim say Fulani dey kontrol and retain large amount of political power in a way wey e affect and komot odas, no dey totally wrong. No be lie say di Fulani political aristocracy don find way to prolong dis kontrolthroughmago-mago agenda of exclusive empowerment and appointment for di strategic areas of di kontri polity and economy.
This fulanisation agenda has predictably turned the other ethnic groups including even the closest, the Hausa, against the Fulani especially as the latter are fingered as being responsible for the banditry, kidnapping and other violent crimes in the North west of the country.	Dis fulanisation agenda, as we expect, don turn oda ethnic group includin Hausa wey be di closest, against di Fulani, especially as dem don point am say na Fulani bin dey responsible for di banditry, kidnappin and oda violent crimes for North-West of di kontri.
In the current situation that Nigeria finds itself, it is no longer feasible for the Fulani to continue to exercise the skewered and disproportionate control of political power.	In di current situation wey Nigeria dey, e no dey feasible again for Fulani to kontinue dey exercise di skewered and large kontrol of political power.
This not only creates a dangerous imbalance in the polity; it also fosters a feeling and tendency by politically excluded ethnic groups to seek ways of disrupting the polity as we are having it now.	Dis no go only create a dangerous imbalance in di polity; e go also bring up a feelin, and tendency by di ethnic groups wey dem komot for politiks, to find ways wey dem go take disrupt di polity as we dey get am now.
For Nigeria to get out of the dangerous quagmire of uncertainty currently building up, we must address the issue of a skewered political and economic control of Nigeria exercised by the powerful and influential ethnic groups to the exclusion of others.	For Nigeria to kommot for di dangerous situation of doubt wey dey build up currently, we must to address di issue of a bias political and economic kontrol of Nigeria, wey di powerful and influential ethnic groups dey show, to di exclusion of odas.
Another issue that hangs around Nigerian politics and governance like an albatross has to do with our dangerous attachments to ethnic and religious leanings and seeking to interpret everything in our country along those lines.	Anoda mata wey hang around Nigerian politiks and governance like burden wey dey pesin neck, get to do wit awa dangerous attachment to ethnic and religious ways, and awa effort to interpret evritin for awa kontri along dose lines.
We are not Nigerians in the true sense of the word.	We no be Nigerians for di true sense of di word.
Our sense of ourselves as Nigerians is defined to a large extent only by the geographical area covering the country rather than by shared values and identities.	Awa sense of togedaness as Nigerians to a large extent dey defined only by di land wey join all of us togeda rada dan by di value and identity wey we share togeda.
We identify ourselves more from our ethnic and religious perspective at the expense of the Nigeria we all belong.	Na base on my-pipo, una-pipo and my-religion una-religion level we take dey relate wit eachoda, rada dan as Nigerians wey we all be. 
The proclivity to play the ethnic and religious card has become so pervasively self-perpetuating that where it is not even necessary, we try to invoke it just to assure ourselves that this is the normal thing to do.	Di proclivity to play di ethnic and religious card don becom so pervasively sef-perpetuatin to di extent say wia e no even dey necessari, we go try to invoke am jus to assure awaself say dis na di normal tin to do.
If the ethnic card does not apply, we reach for the religious card and where the religious card does not, we apply the ethnic card.	If my-pipo, una-pipo card no wok, we go use my-religion, una-religion card, and for wia dat wan no work, we go use di my-pipo una-pipo own. 
We have come to believe so much in these factors as a yardstick for just about everything we do that, like an addict hooked on the self-deceiving exhilaration of the substance, we just cannot muster the courage to kick the habit even as we know how injurious it is to our body politic.	We don too biliv dis factors as yardstick for almost evritin wey we do, sotey like addict wey dey deceive e sef on di happiness of takin substance, we just fit no gada di courage to kick di habit. Even say we sabi how harmful e be to awa bodi politic.

Speaker, followed suit and passed the Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.	Di speaker sef follow wetin dem do and he pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As you may well be aware, the Bill to establish the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) has been one of the most viciously attacked and antagonised bill in the National Assembly in recent times.	As una fit don hear before, di Bill wey dem wan take establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) dey among di bill wey dem don tok NO to for inside National Assembly.
Sadly the attacks came from those who ought to be partners in progress in the fight against endemic corruption in Nigeria, but have rather designated themselves as enemies of the general good.	Di sad thing be say na pipo wey suppose dey put mouth for di fight against corrupt waka for inside Naija dey attack di bill, dem don turn to enemy for common ood.
Good is good it has no substitute so also is bad.	Gud thing na gud thing, e no get substitute, na so bad thing sef be.
No matter how long it takes, good always prevails over bad just as the superiority of light over darkness remain constant and unquestionable	No mata as e take long reach, good go always prevails ova bad just as di light superior ova darknes take dey constant and unquestionable
na so di Bill to establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) prevail over im antagonist and today di two Chamber for di National Assembly don pass di bill into law.	
It is indeed important for us to have a glimpse of how it all happened at the National Assembly.	e dey important say say make we see small of how e take happen for di National Assembly.
Interestingly, The Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) was first passed into law by the 9th Senate on the 2nd day of March, 2021 having undergone the rigour of legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual at its 3rd Reading on the 2nd March, 2021 the bill was unanimously passed into law by the Nigeria Senate having deeply considered the urgent need for this noble legislation, of course this was not without series of thunder bolts from detractors who would not stop at any length to see that any legislation that would be helpful in assisting the Buhari-led administration to fight corruption does not see the light of the day but the senate stood firm and saw it through.	E dey interestin say, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na di 9th Senate first pass am into law  on di 2nd day of March, 2021 as e done pass di  legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for di 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 senate dem pass di Bill  into law  wit one voice when dem don consider di urgent need  for di noble legislation, of kos no be sauy e apun without plenty  thunder bolts from detractors  wey no go stop at any lenght to see say any legislation wey go help di administration wey Buhari lead to fight corruption no see see light of day but senate stand welwel and dem see am through. 
It is very important for the public to know that (CIFIPN) is not just a noble body but a novel one in Nigeria that is targeted at bridging the gap that has long been existing in the forensics space.	E dey very important for make public know say (CIFIPN) no be just any noble bodi but a new one for Naija wey dem target say make e bridge di gap wey don dey for long for di forensics space.
Today, the journey to having a standard body that would regulate the practice of forensics in Nigeria is at its peak and Nigerians must rise to challenge the few anti-government bodies that would want to sabotage this step.	Today, di waka to get one standard bodi wey go dey regulate di practice of forensics for Naija for im peak and make Naija pipo rise make dem challenge di few anti-goment bodi wey fit intend to sabotage dis step. 
The passage of this Bill by the National Assembly, no doubt, is a clear demonstration of its patriotic zeal and the need to further strengthen all national efforts geared towards the fight against corruption, which has hindered development in every aspect of our national lives. 	Dis bill wey National Assembly don pass, show say clearly dem demonstrate say dem dey patriotic and di need to strengthen national efforts against corruption, wey don stand dey block development for evri aspect of awa national live.
This legislative bold step, taken by the two Chambers of the National Assembly, is quite historic and symbolic, coming at a time that Nigeria is in dire need of legislation(s)	Dis beta step for inside legislation , wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey historic and symbolic, e dey happen at a time wey Nigeria dey need legislation welwel.
that will give more bite to its anti-corruption drive in view of the raising spate of criminal and corrupt practices, across the globe.	dat one go give beta way for im anti-corruption drive as di spate of criminal and corrupt waka don rise across di globe.
As we all know, crime generally, has assumed a new dimension, due to advancement in science and technology in the 21st Century. 	As we all sabi, crime don enter anoda level as science and technology don improve for 21st century.
Therefore, the passage of this Bill is apt and timely and it has shown clearly that we have flexible and responsive Legislature that is in tune and in touch with emerging global realities and ever-ready to enact legislations that will meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians. 	Therefore, as dem pass di bill dey gud and e apun for beta time, plus e don show clearly say we get flexible and responive legislature wey sabi di thing wey dey apun for di world, and dem dey redi to do legislation wey go meet wetin Nigeria pipo dey talk.
It is apposite to also state that the journey, which culminated into the passage of this Bill, began in the 8th National Assembly whereby, our Bill was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, Ph.D, CON, the current President of Senate when he was a Senate Leader, because of its strategic importance to the anti-corruption drive of this administration. 	Make we also tok say di journey wey dey for inside as dem take pass di bill make e for turn to law, don start since di 8th National Assembly, wia Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan Ph.D, CON wey be current Senate President sponsor awa bill, when he be senate Leader, bikos e dey important to di anti corruption waka of dis admiistration.
For the benefit of hindsight, when our Bill was introduced in the two Chambers during the 8th National Assembly, all-inclusive public hearings were conducted by the relevant Committees of the respective Chambers. 	For beta understandin, when we be introduce awa bill for inside di two chamber durin di 8th Assembly, dem do public hearin wey carry evribodi along for inside di chamber.
Thereafter and in spite of opposition from stakeholders who were in the minority, led by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), the National Assembly passed the Bill, in view of its significance and the part it will play in the fight against corruption.  	Thereafter, and ontop say minority pipo wey be stakeholder oppose am, na Institute of Chatered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead dem, di National Assembly pass di bill, with view of how e take get significance and di part wey go play for di fight against corruption.
Afterward, the Bill was forwarded to Mr President for Presidential Assent, which was not given before the Dissolution of the 8th National Assembly in June, 2019. 	Afterward, dem forward di bill give oga Presido, make e for put hand, but e neva put hand before dem scatter di 8th Assembly for inside June 2019.
It is on the strength of this, that the Bill was re-introduced in this 9th National Assembly and this time around, it was sponsored by Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, the current Leader of the Senate, in view of the importance attached to it.	Na on dis stregth dem take bring di bill abck for di 9th National Assembly, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, di current Leader for di Senate, in view of as e take dey important.
We are constrained to make this clarification in order to clear the air on the cheap propaganda being propelled by our detractors that our Bill was rejected by the 8th National Assembly. 	We dey pushed to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap cheap propaganda wey pipo wey dey distract us dey tok say di 8th Assembly don reject awa bill.
Also worthy of mention is the fact that our Bill has being mistaken for similar Bills, which were recently introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives Chambers. 	 Also we suppose mention di fact say dem don mistake awa bill with abother bill dem wey dey similar wey dem just introduce for both di senate and House of Represntative Chambers. 
These Bills, upon our close scrutiny, we discovered that they are merely duplications of the intents and purports of our Bill. 	Dis bill dem, as we don scrutize dem with close eye, we discover say dem just copy awa intention and di thing wey awa bill stand for.
It must be stressed that none of these Bills were introduced in the 8th National Assembly, other than our Bill. 	We suppose draw hear tok am say dem no introduce any of di bills dem for inside 8th Assembly, na only awa bill.
As such, we are the first to ever come up with a Bill of this magnitude,(Forensic) 	As such, na we be di first to carry bill wey big reach like dis (Forensic)
having seen the urgent need to establish such great Institute.  	As we don see say e dey very urgent to establish dat kind great Institute.
The decision to establish the Institute was taken after a painstaking study of how the Institutes operate in other jurisdictions and how well they have helped in crime detection, investigation and prosecution.   	Dem take di decision wey dem take establish di Institute afta dem study how di Institute dey take operate for other jurisdiction and how dem don take help crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
It is instructive to note that our Institute has been in existence since 2009. 	Na part of instruction make dem for know say awa Institute don dey since 2009.
And over the years, we have trained professionals in the field of forensic science and technology, targeted at inculcating the requisite skills and acumen in the pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:	And over di years, And over di years, we don train professionala to sabi forensic science technology, targeted at inculcatin di requisite skil dem for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
forensic analysis to eliminate material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cybersecurity; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation, etc.  	 make dem fit take forensic analysis eliminate material misstatement, whether na by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cybersecurity; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation etc.
You will agree with me that in today's world, the conventional ways of investigating crimes, with a view to fighting it has become obsolete. 	You go follow me reason say for inside di obodo world wey we dey today, di normal way wey we dey take investigate crime, on to say we want stop am don bikom old something.
As such, for us as a nation to do something meaningful in this regard, it is paramount that we align ourselves with the global trend and emerging innovations, targeted at fighting corruption.	As such, make we as a kontri for do something wey get meanin for dis matter, e dey paramount say make we follow global trend and new innovations, wey dem put for ground to take fight corruption.
It is in line with this reasoning that the idea of establishing this Institute was conceived with a well-structure laudable objectives that are relevant to the anti-corruption drive of this administration. 	Na dis kind way we take reason to establish dis Institute wey get betta objective dat is relevant to di anti-corruption agenda of dis administration.
Time will not permit me to highlight all the objectives of the Bill here. 	Time no too dey for me to tok about evrithing wey dey inside di bill for here.
However, I wish to crave your indulgence to highlight a few of the objectives of the Bill, for the purpose of this address, as follows: 	However, I wan make you allow me to mention few of wetin di Bill go do, for di purpose of dis tok, as e take be like dis:
To establish a Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria in order to develop and train Professionals in this specialized field, through systemic and professional examination and certification that will enhance the acquisition of the requisite skills in the use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and prevention; 	say make we for establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria, to develop and train professional for inside dis specialised field, with systemic and professional examination and certification wey go give better skil inside use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and detection;
To provide a platform for training and re-training of intending professionals in the usage of Forensic Science and technological tools and techniques in the investigation of frauds in both public and private sectors of our economy, in line with international best practices; 	To provide platform wey dem go dey take train and retrain of pipo wey wan bikom professional on top how dem dey take use Forensic Science and Technology tools and techniques dey investigate fraud for both public and private sector of di economy, as dem dey take do evriwia;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes amongst practitioners in the field, in a bid to stem fraudulent and corruption practices, and as well develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally; 	To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes among pipo wey dey do di, in a bid to cut fraudul and corruption waka, and as well develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally;  
To fill the existing huge vacuum in our archaic and conventional system of investigation with the introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help the country from expending its scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations in Nigeria; 	To take fill di huge vacuum wey dey exist for awa  normal system of investigation weu don old with di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help di country from expending im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations for inside Naija; 
To develop a broad-based mechanism and training programmes that cut across all the strata of our investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists. 	To develop broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey go cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists. 
This would enhance effective and efficient disposition of cases in line with global best practices; and 	Dis one go enhance effective plus efficient disposition of cases as dem dey take do am globally; and
To enhance Nigerias anti-fraud mechanisms, through the provision of a legal framework for the professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals in Nigeria, among others.	To take enhance anti-fraud mechanism for Naija, through di provision of a legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Naija, among odas.
From the foregoing, it is apparent that the role of this Institute is quite strategic and important.	From di foregoing, e don show say di role of dis Institute dey strategic and important.
It is also pertinent to reiterate that forensic science is a very wide and all-encompassing field, which requires effective and efficient regulation for the attainment and sustainability of high level professionalism and ethical standards. 	E also dey important make we tok say forensic science dey very wide and na field wey involve many oda, and e require effective and efficient regulation make we for attain and sustain high level professionalism and ethical standard.
The broad spectrum of the scope and focal point of the Institute, includes but not limited to forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.	Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, includes but no be only forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Accordingly, you will agree with me that our Institute is bringing on board, a unique concept of crime detection and investigation in conformity with international best practices.	Accordingly, you go agree say awa Institute don bring unique concept enter crime detection and investigation wey follow international best practices.
This concept is far beyond the reasoning of those whose myopic view about the purports of our Bill have beclouded their senses of reasoning, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, which is outside their jurisdiction and scope of operations.	Di concept pass as myopic pipo dey take thingk about awa bill don cover dem sense of thingkin, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey don pass dem jurisdiction and scope of operation.
On a lighter note, I wish to draw the attention of everyone to the funny scenario that is playing out now, and as a matter of fact, it should be a source of concern for all well-meaning Nigerians. 	 On a lighter note, I wan draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario dat is playin out now, and as a matter of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all beta Naija pipo.
When the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill was introduced in the 8th National Assembly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), came out vehemently to oppose its passage because according to them, it is an unnecessary duplication of functions already undertaken by their Institute.	Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out wit anger to oppose di passage bikos according to dem, na unnecessary duplication of function wey dem Institute don dey do. 
However, upon the re-introduction of our Bill in this 9th National Assembly, and having seen the overwhelming and accelerated legislative supports, our Bill has received from the two Chambers, ICAN has now realized that forensic science is a unique field of practice, and as we speak, they have introduced a similar Bill that is currently before the House of Representatives, having failed woefully in their attempts to stop the passage of our Bill.	However, as dem don take introduce awa bill again for dis 9th National Assembly, and as we don see di overwhelmin and accelerated legislative support wey di two Chambers don give awa bill, ICAn don realize say forensic science na uniques field of practice, and as we dey talk, dem don bring similar Bill kom meet di House of Representative, as dem don fail wofully for dem attempt to stop di passage of dis awa bill. 
One may ask, what has changed between now and the past, where ICAN holds the view that there shouldn't be any Institute other than theirs to regulate the practice of forensic science?	One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say make any oda Institute no dey regulate di practices of forensic science?
your answer is as good as mine.	Your answer na di same thing with my own.
I wish to also inform you that the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), is not left out of this funny theatrical episode.	I for also like inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), also dey part of dis di episode.
Just like their ICAN counterpart, they have also introduced a Bill in the House of Representatives with the nomenclature the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN.	 which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN. Just as dem ICAN counterpart, dey sef don introduce one bill for inside House of Representative wey di same structure with di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey be na ANAN initiate am, and na dem promote am.
I decided to bring out all these facts so that Nigerians and even the international communities will understand the extent to which some people can go in order to achieve their aims.	I decide say make I tok all di fact dem make Nigeria pipo and even international community for understand di extent to which some pipo fit go say make dem for achieve dem aim.
However, we are not perturbed by these developments because we believe in the credibility and ability of the National Assembly and indeed the Presidency to do what is right and not to allow themselves to be manipulated in any way, by these unnecessary distractions, so as not to make a mockery of the entire thing.	However, dis development no disturb us at all, bikos we believe ontop credibility and ability of di National Assembly and also for di Presidency to do di correct thing, make dem no enter manipulate in any way, with dis unnecessarydistractions dem, make dem for no make mockery of do whole thing.
The known practical and antagonist of this Bill has remained ICAN for reason that is now becoming obvious.	Na ICAN be di practical and antagonist for dis bill and we don dey see di reason now. 
They engaged several bystanders into writing frivolous petitions some even targeted at the leadership of the Senate with a tone of blackmail.	Dem engage several bystanders into make dem write bad petition, dem even target di leadership for inside Senate, and e sound like say na bleckmail.
Having failed woefully at the senate, the antagonists shifted their attention to the House of Representatives with the same bystanders writing all manner of publication.	As dem don fail for inside Senate, di antagonist shift attention go House of Representative with di same bystanders as dem just dey write many many publication.
Yet again, they failed.	and again, dem fail.
Ordinarily by legislative procedure, a bill that has been passed by the Senate would only require concurrence by the House safe for where there are observations.	Ordinarily according to legislative procedure, bill wey Senate don passgo only need concurrence by di House except wen dem get observation.
But in the case of the CIFIPN Bill, the antagonist fought the passage of the bill until truth prevail and on the 19th May, 2021 the Bill for the establishment of the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of what Standard Knowledge and Skills to be Attained by Persons seeking to become Registered Members and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matters (HB. 791) was passed into law by the House of Representative.	But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di pipo wey dey against am fight am until truth win for 19 day of May, 2021 wey House of Representative pass di Bill establishment of the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin di Standard Knowledge and Skil dem wey pesin wey wan bikom rigistered member must get and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matter (HB. 791)
ICAN has now registered its Bill in the House of Representatives titled (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.	ICAN don register dem own Bill for inside di House of Respresentatives wey dem title  (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
This ICAN new Bill has in it full of provision for practice of forensic, and also that they will establish a Forensic University in Nigeria and without which nobody can practice forensic in Nigeria, and violation of this section will lead such a person to some years imprisonment.	Di new Bill wey ICAn bring get contain full provision to dey take practice forensic, plus say dem wan establish forensic university for inside Nigeria, and without am, nobodi go fit practice forensics for Nigeria, and pesin wey violate am go enter prison for some years.
This sounds so strange in a country full of enlightened people.	Dis wan dey strange for ear for inside kontri wey plenty oepn eye pipo dey.
My joy is that Nigeria is not a Banana Republic	D tin wey make me api be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
no matter the level of corruption therein.	No mata di level of coruption wey dey dere.
We are already challenging the passage of the bills by the House of Representatives.	We don dey challenge as House of Representatives take pass bill.
It should be noted that, our challenging the bill is not borne out of malice or ill will, but because we are certain that the purpose of this bill is to halt presidential assent under the guise of existence of similar legislation.	We suppose note am say, as we dey challenge di bill no be for bad belle, but bikos say we dey certain say di purpose of di bill na to stop presidential assent under di disguise say similar legislation don dey before.
We will not allow ourselves and Nigerians to be deceived by their antics.	We no go gree make dem deceive us and Naija people with dem wayo.
You would recall how ICAN vehemently opposed this enactment of CIFIPN and in one of its sponsored publications by the Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)	You go remember how ICAn take open eye oppose di CIFIPN and for inside one pubication wey dem sponsor by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade on the 24th May, 2019 made frantic efforts to say that ICAN under its enabling laws is empowered to practice Forensics and therefore for CIFIPN Bill to be passed it would amount to duplication of laws, today ICAN is presenting its ACT to be repealed and re-enacted with the inclusion of Forensics in the new law.	Olumuyiwa Alade on 24th May, 2019 make plenty effort to tell us say di law wey dey enable ICAN don give am power to do forensics and to pass di CIFIPN Bill go be like dem just dey duplicate law, but today ICAN don dey present dem law say make dem for include forensics inside di new law. 
The question is, what has changed?	Di question is, wetin don change?
The same law that ICAN has always told the public that it has forensics is now seeking for its re-enactment.	Di same law wey ICAN wey ICAN don tell di public say e get forensics kom dey seek say make dem re-enact am.
As always, while we are not opposed to any group proposing the inclusion of forensics in its laws, we are however concerned that a body should not try to perpetuate itself.	As always, as we no dey oppose any group wey dey propose say make dem include forensics fot dem law, awa concern be say make one bodi no try perpetuate imsef.
ICAN and its cohorts have realised their inability to stop the passage of CIFIPN	ICAN and dem cohorts don realise dem inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN 
so they want to have a body within itself.	So dem wan get one union for demsef.
What they are scared of is checks and balances, they would not want another professional body to investigate their activities because they know what they are doing to the economy of this nation.	Na checks and balances dey fear dem, dem no go want want make anoda professional bodi to investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.
How can they want to be a judge in their own case?	How dem go wan dey judge dem own case by demsef?
This sounds so strange.	Dis one sound strange welwel.
On this note, we are calling on the National Assembly to beware of the antics of these groups, they cannot be speaking from both sides of their mouth and expect the National Assembly to be cajoled.	On dis note, we dey  call on di National Assembly to beware of di wayo wey dis group get, dey no suppose dey talk from both sides of dem mouth,make dem kom dey  expect to use am cajole National Assembly.
We want to yet again appreciate the doggedness of the 9th Assembly in ensuring that the Bill is passed, the Nigerian people are more than ever before convinced of the readiness of this administration to combat corruption through every possible means and would at all times encourage legislation that is aimed at achieving this goal.

For di Tuesday wey just pass, di Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), for Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, be invite relevant stakeholders, plus journalist, to kom witness di third harvest of di Tela Maize Variety Confined Field Trials (CFT) under im Tela Maize Research Project wey di  Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) dey fund.
The maize variety derived its name TELA from the Latin word TUTELA which means protection.	Dem derive di name for di maize variety TELA for Latin TUTELA wey mean protection.
The maize variety is bred with protection against insect pests and draught.	Dis kind maize na im get protection against pest and draught for im breed.
The Principal Investigator, Professor Rabiu Adamu and other scientists who conducted journalists round the harvest, said the idea of the research work was to produce maize varieties that are resistance or that are highly protected against two major insect pests: stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm and additional protection against moderate draught.	Professor Rabiu Adamu wey be Principal Investigator, plus oda scientist wey carry journalists round d harvest, tok say di idea of di project na to produce maize variety wey dey resistance or wey dey protected against two major insect pest: stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm plus another protection against moderate draught.
This is all about producing crops that are high yielding under stressed conditions; the stresses are Fall Army Warm and stem borers, which are major constraints to maize production.

So, in essence, this is what we are trying to showcase,the Principal researcher said.	Di Principal researcher tok say na wetin dem dey try showcase be dat.
With the three CFT trials successful, researchers will have to test and validate them from the farmers field to show that what they recorded from their own research station equally performs well in the farmers fields on wide range of locations over wide ecological conditions, beginning from 2021 rainy season.	As di three CFT trial don dey successful, pipo wey dey do research go need to test and validate dem to show say wetin dem record for inside dem research station dey perform well for inside di farmers field for different locations and ecological conditions as e go start for di rainy season of 2021.

The varieties under trials were infested three times unlike the previous ones to virtually look at the efficacy of the BT gene in the maize product.	We don infest di varieties wey we dey put for trial three times unlike di previous one make we for take look how di BT gene take dey effective reach for di maize product.
With the outcome, researchers said the yield will definitely increase above 17 per cent.	With di outcome, researcher dem don tok say di yield go increase reach 17 percent.
So after, we're going to analyze the data and then prepare a document to get approval for environmental release.	So afta, we go analyze di data, and go prepare document to take get approval for environmental release.

Farmers are going to have yield increase of 17 percent and you know that farming is all about productivity and harvestable yield.	Farmer dem yield go increase by 17 percent and you know say na productivity and harvest be di koko for farming.
Once you have yield, of cause you're going to have bumper harvest and profit.	Once you don gree, you go get plenty harvest and profit.

Between DSS and regional separatists	Between DSS and pipo wey wan separate for some region
Repeated warnings by the DSS to persons and groups whose utterances and activities persistently constitute provocative disruptions of the ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonious co-existence of the majority common folks of this country, were beginning to sound monotonous and unconvincing until guilty conscience forced the prime suspects out of their deceptive demeanour.	As DSS don put hand for ear for group and pipo dem wey dey tok and do things wey fit provoke and distrupt di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonous co-existence of di majority common folk of di kontri, don begin dey sound like say na one pesin tok until dem force dem komot for wia dem dey deceive pipo.
Lingering questions about who or which persons and groups the security agency was referring to were promptly vapourized in the heated rhetorical outbursts of the nation's prominent geo-ethnic agitators 	Question wey don dey linger about who or which pesin and group di security agent dey follow tok na im dem  promptly vapourized for di heated rhetorical outbust of di nation prominent geo-ethnic agitator dem.
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).	Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
It then dawned on all that indeed these were the persons and groups  that have continued to resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements, and acts to pit citizens against one another in order to apparently inflame the embers of tribal and religious discord, as the DSS charged in one of its warnings.	E kom clear for all of us eye say dis na di group of pipo wey don kontinu to dey resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statement and act dem, to take set kontri pipo against demsef to take put fire of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS din charge for one of dem warning.
Interestingly, none of these prime suspects in the exploitation of some fault lines to cause ethno-religious violence in some parts of the country could categorically distance itself from the treacherous and subversive activities detected by the security agency.	Interestingly, non for inside di major suspect dem for di exploitation of some fault line dem to take kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance demsef from di treacherous and subversive activity dem wey security agent detect.
They chorused a common conviction that the DSS knows those responsible, differing only in the respective directions of their accusing fingers.	Dem chorus di same conviction say di DSS sabi di pipo wey dey responsible, dem only differ for di direction wey dem dey point dem accusing finger.
While Afenifere retorted these people know those who are responsible for these acts but can't touch them because of their connections, PANDEV rehashed its grouse about many people feeling alienated and ACF feigned ignorance, asking who are the people?	AS Afenifere tok say dis pipo sabi di ones wey dey responsible for di acts, but dem no fit touch dem bikos of di connect wey dem get, PANDEV tok am again about plenty pipo wey dey run alienated and ACF dey do like say dem no know, dem dey ask who di pipo be?
Since the DSS knows them and their satanic mission, they should be proactive in dealing with them.	Since di DSS know dem and dem satanic waka, make dem take action to take deal with dem.
The NEF sounded unconvinced with if there are people pushing the country into deeper crises and they are known; they should be treated according to the law.	Di NEF sound like pesin wey no dey convinced with if say pipo dey wey dey push di kontri enter deep crises  and dem know dem, make dem treat dem accordin to di law.
You don't have to be a spook to know what the DSS knows about each and all of these flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics in Nigeria or to understand why they all know that DSS knows them yet they insist on passing the buck outside their cliques.	You no need to be spook to know wetin di DSS sabi about dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS sabi dem yet dem insist to pass di buck outside dem clique.
The truth is that these champions of ethnic politics know of no better solution to Nigeria's myriad problems than for their sectional enclaves and chiefs to lord it over the rest of the country as rulers, not leaders!	 Di truth be say dis pipo wey dey champion ethnic politics no sabi any better solution to di problem wey Nigeria dey face than make dem sectional enclave and chief dey lord am ova di remainin of di kontri as rulers, not leaders!
So desperate and unscrupulous are they in pursuing their inordinate ambitions that they absurdly and frequently agitate for break-up of Nigeria.	Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous to pursue dem inordinate ambition dem dat dem dey agitate absurdly and frequently to take break Nigeria up.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate their geographical consciousness to reduce all it takes to excising the territorial contours of their enclaves with the frenzied ease of cutting their portion of the remaining crumbs of the proverbial national cake.	Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all it takes to excising di territorial contours of dia enclaves with di frenzied ease of cutting dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake. 
But, for the land-locked ACF/NEF agitators and their Afenifere antagonists, the only way out of a broken up Nigeria is to cascade down a mega sink hole, if their myopic manoeuvres are not to lead to a suicidal breaking into neighbouring Benin and Niger republics, currently hosting herds of gunmen, turbaned terrorists  and ISWAP insurgents on border patrol.	
Simply put, breaking up or out of Nigeria as an ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambitions of persons or groups restlessly undermining aspirations of majority wa-zo-bia Nigerian commoners for enduring peaceful coexistence, is easier said than done.	To put am simple, to break up or out of Nigeria as one ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambition of pipo or group wey dey undermine di ambition of majority wa-zo-bia Nigeria commoner restlessly for enduring peaceful coexistence, e easy to tok pass to do. 
These regional groups actually constitute major hindrances to the steady attainment of unity and peaceful coexistence that Nigeria has been labouring for since flag independence.	All dis group be major block to di steady attainment of unity and to dey live together in peace wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag of independence.
For as long as they continue to parade the political terrain as ethnic champions, for so long will they regard Nigeria as an entitlement for their ethnic stake in the population, to be claimed or seized and, if all else fails, deconstructed and disowned as a failed state.	For as long as dem kontinu to parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, na for so long wey dem go regard Nigeria as an entitlement for dem ethnic stake for di population, to be claimed or seized, and if all fail, make dem deconstruct am and disown am as state wey don fail.
Whenever they meet, the agenda is not for Nigeria's progress and development, unless its leadership is firmly in their grasp, otherwise it is all about heckling and jostling around with barely concealed determination to deploy the notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against the incumbent non-indigene President.	Whenever dem meet, di agenda no be for say make Nigeria for progress and develop, unless di leadership dey dem hand firmly, odawise na all about hecking and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Whether it is ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, their existence and activities will always be antithetical to Nigeria's quest for unity, peace and development.	Whether na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dem existence and activities go dey oppose di quest of Nigeria for unity, peace and development.
Another undeniable indictment of these regional separatists is that they are all self-styled political pressure groups masquerading as representatives of various ethnic groups.	Anoda indicment wey we no fit deny for dis regional separatist be say all of dem na sel-styled political pressure groups wey dey pretend like representative of various ethnic groups dem.
From their membership, it is plain to see that they consist of ex-this	From di membership, E dey plain to see dat dey consist of ex-this
Ironically, this political deficiency gives them the impetus to come together, desperate to remain relevant in a democratic system run entirely by elected representatives through registered political parties with legislative and executive institutions constitutionally established to dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.	Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem di ginger to kom togeda, desperate say make dem remain relevant for democratic system wey elected representative dey run through registered political parti dem wit  legislative and executive institution wey dem establish wit constitution to take dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
The geo-ethnic groups only have a nasty nuisance value in our democratic setting as they persist in acts of mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion, all brazenly intended to make Nigeria ungovernable as they often threaten and attempt,  so that, perchance, they can regain political relevance if not control.	Na only nasty nuisance value wey di geo-ethnic groups dem get for awa democratic setin as dem kontinu with mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion wey dem intend to take make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey threaten and dem dey attempt so dat if dem get chance dem fit regain political relevance plus kontrol.
That is why their frequent clandestine meetings trigger security alerts!	Na why dem frequesnt meetin don dey cause security alert!
With such predator-politicians lurking around the perimeters of power with dubious intent of undermining an elected government just because they are not involved, it is beyond reasonable doubt that there must be a convergence of interest linking their overt activities and the covert criminalities of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, combined to make Nigeria ungovernable.	Wit dis kind predator-politician dem wey dem dey waka ariund di perimeter of power wit dubious intent and dem dey undermine goment wey dem elect just bikos say dem no dey involved for di, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say convergence of interest dey wey dey link dem overt activity dem and di covert criminality of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, combine to take make Nigeria no dey governable.
Double jeopardy aptly describes the predicament of the Buhari administration having to contend with such array of formidable foes unleashing incessant assaults on national security in a time of unprecedented economic adversity.	Na double danger fit describe di tryin situation of di Buhari administration as dem get to handle such nomba of formidable enemy wey dey unleash plenty assaults on national security for di time wey economy dey face new difficult things. 
To that extent, there can only be two groups of politicians: those who are positively participating in the democratic dispensation as partners in moving the nation forward against all odds and those who are negatively engaged in sowing seeds of discord and disorder to destabilize the country.	To dat extent, only two group of politician fit dey: dos wey dey participate with positive mind for di democratic dispensation wey dem be partner for movin di kontri forward against all odds and dos wey get negative mind wey dey bring discord and disorder to take distabilize di kontri.
By their utterances and activities, we all know them!	By wetin dem dey tok and wetin dem dey do, we all sabi dem!
At the end of the day, the majority of Nigerians are ordinary citizens whose conditions of survival were not determined by and not dependent on the geography of their origin.	At di end of di day, di majority fo Naija pipo be ordinary citizen wey dem condition to take survive no dey follow or depend on top wia dem come from.
Their daily struggles to eke a living are sustained by submission to the will of One God irrespective of differences of faith.	Dem struggle evri day to make livin dey follow dem submission to di will of one God even as dem faith dey different.
Nigeria is their destined fatherland to which they remain loyal, law abiding and prayerful, knowing they have no other country to call theirs, collectively showing how citizenship breeds true patriotism.	Nigeria na dem fatherland wey destiny don put dem, and dem remain loyal, dem dey follow and dem dey pray, bkos dem know say dem no get any othe kontri to call dem own, togeda dem dey show how citizenship go fit breed true patriotism.
They too know that Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to pit citizens against one another in order to inflame the embers of tribal and religious discord for the political ambitions of their leaders.	Dem also know say Afenifere,  Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) don dey use incitin, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to take put citizen against one anoda say make dem fit put fire for di tribal and religious wahala for di political ambition of dem leaders.

Seven issues that will make or mar Nigeria to 2023.	Na  seven things go make or destroy Nigeria for 2023. 
Buffeted by deep-seated existential challenges which the leadership has proved incapable of tackling, many are coming to the belief that Nigerias future survival as a country is not certain.	Buffeted by deep – seated existence challenge wey di leaders no fit tackle, many people don belief say di future survival of Nigeria no dey sure. 
The signs certainly are there clearly manifested in all facets of life; large swathes of the country are now under the control of non-state actors, a shrinking economy characterised rising inflation and poverty, and social sectors in free falling collapse.	Di sign don dey certain and clear for di aspect of life; Many people wey dey under di country don dey under di control of non – state  actors , shrinking economy wey result to rising of inflation and poverty and social sector wey don fall yakata. 
But the most dangerous of all is the growing lack of trust between the leadership and the led as well as among the various ethnic groups and social classes making up the country.	But  di one wey dangerous pass na di lack of trust wey dey among our leaders, pipo and all di ethnic groups and di social class of pipo wey make up di kontri.
That Nigeria is currently hurtling towards a decisive defining moment in its existence as a country cannot be denied.	Di fact say currently Nigeria don dey go toward a delicate moment of hin existence as a kontri wey no fit bi denied. 
To be sure, there is no country that is immune from challenges at whatever period of its existence.	To dey sure, no kontri wey dem no face challenges from di start.
But the difference between success and failure to manage these challenges lies mainly with the leadership and how it copes with the issues of governance that come up from time to time in the life of a nation.	But di different wey dey between success and failure na di leaders wey no sabi manage di challenges and di way dem dey cope wit issues of di nation.
In this regard, looking at the degenerating situation in Nigeria across all facets of our life, the abject failure of leadership at all levels to engender confidence in their ability to come to grips with the deep challenges facing the country is glaring.	As he dey go, as we dey look di soso deteriorate wahala including di mata of our life all failure of our leaders of all levels of situations make dem take better hand hold di mata  wey dey face the kontri make he better.
Hence the dangerous but understandable doubts among a growing number of Nigerians that the countrys future existence is uncertain.	Soso many Nigerians dey doubt say di future of di kontri fit no bitter again. 
This feeling is gaining greater traction as we inch towards the next circle of elections in 2023 which many believe might be more problematic than the previous ones.	Di thought of di people bi say di election wey go take place for 2023 go get plenty palava pass the ones wey we don get before.
Proceeding from the principle that a problem identified is a problem almost solved, I have identified seven major issues confronting the country not necessarily by pecking order, which require urgent attention, failing which may finally tip the country into the abyss.	Dey notice say di problem wey we see na him dey get solution, I don gather seven problems wey dey cause wahala wey need quick attention to solve and failing to solve doz problem fit make di kontri fall apart.
The Fulani question is one of the raging issues in the country which requires a nuanced perspective and approach.	Di Fulani problem na him bi di number one koko wey of di matter wey dey cause kasala wey we gat take eye look into.

Di soso fight we don dey hear about di Fulani herders and di farmers in kontri dey cause contradictory and hatred between normal pipo and di aimless families of di Fulani’s.
It is more to do with the place of the Fulani in the historical, political and social evolution of Nigeria.	We gat put mouth for di position wey Fulani hold in di histrorical, political and social evolution of  Nigeria. 
In many ways, Nigeria can be described as a joint legacy of nineteenth century Fulani Jihadist Sheikh Usman dan Fodio, and Sir Frederick Lugard, the architect of amalgamation and first British colonial Governor-General of Nigeria.

They control one half of the traditional/spiritual realm through the Islamic religion as well as the temporal turf of Nigerian politics and governance.	Na dem dey control one half of di traditional/spiritual realm through di Islamic religion as well as di temporal turf of Nigeria politics and governance. 
That the Fulani have deployed this unique advantage in the struggle for the control of the soul of Nigerian politics opens them to accusation with some reason of wanting to perpetually control political power in the country to the exclusion and detriment of other ethnic groups.

Reasons wheat price will remain high	Reason why wheat still dey cost.

For uncountable years, di tori of wheat for Nigeria dey dey well even as federal goment and task force take tok say take add join wheat wey dem dey produce.  
The challenge forced many wheat farmers to direct their energy more towards rice which enjoys favourable policies and funding.	Di shallenge now don force many farmers wey dey plant wheat carry dia power go dey plant rice wey dey enjoy funding and policies wey sweat body. 
The local demand for wheat has grown to over 6 million tonnes (MTs) in 2021 due to a growing population estimated at over 200 million.	Wheat wey dem dey demand for we domot don rish over 6 million tonnes (MTs) as we take dey plenty more more wey dem estimate say na over 200 million.

So we were told to go back to Unity Bank where we have the exposure.	So dem say make we waka go Unity Bank wia we get di gbese.
However, we highlighted three or four points; that they should continue with the programme with us so that one, we will have sustainability in wheat production; two, defaulting farmers are not the ones to be engaged in the programme so that it will serve as a lesson to them and it will encourage them to pay back and rejoin; three, we will have learnt from our past experiences in recovery and come up with something more effective in the recovery system; and four, deployment of mechanisation that will make the programme sustainable.	We draw out like three or four point say make dem continue di programme wit us so dat one; We go fit produce wheat wella; two, nor be di farmer wey march law dey go di programme so e go teach dem lesson and go make dem pay backcome join again; three, we go don learn from wetin don happun and we go bring something wey beta to take dey recover; four, to bring katapila wey go make di programme get head.

He said this was going to affect wheat production, noting that even with the ABP, many farmers were still not willing to go into its production.	E tok say dis go affect to dy produce wheat, tok say, as di ABP take dey, plenti farmer no go still wan go into production
Alhaji Sale explained that, It was the association that brought courage for farmers to go into production because of the agreement between them and the offtakers.	Alhaji Sale tok say,na di joinbodi dey give farmers mind go plant becos of di agreement wey dem get wit pipo wey dey buy.  
You cannot grow something that you do not have a market for.	You nor fit plant somtin wey u nor go fit sell.
We tried and created the market between us and the millers.	We try make market dey between we anddimillers. 
Even individuals in wheat farming come through the association to sell the product to the milling plants; and they find it very easy.	Even each persin deycome tru di joinbodicome sell dia market to milling plants and dem dey find am easy.
Now that they are not in the programme, the farmers find it very difficult to sell the product in the market.	Now we di programme nor dey, di farmer dey find am hard to sell their market inside di market.

Drawing Nigeria back from the brinks	E dey drag Nigeria comeot for up.
The worsening security challenges in the country seem to be getting out of hand.	Security mata wey don spoil for di contri don pass normal.
Many who have so far commented on the issue have painted pictures of hopelessness.	Pipo wey don tok on top di mata don tok say hope nor dey.
To say the least, it has reached a point of despair and as human beings, Nigerians are beginning to doubt if we can survive it and live together once again in a peaceful society.	To tok di wan wey small, e don shoke as persin, Nigeria pipo don dey doubt if we fit survive am and live togeda again as area wey get peace. 
Prominent personalities in the country seem to have given up hope which has led to their conclusion that the only way out of the quagmire is for the federal government to seek foreign assistance to be able to tackle the security challenges.	Big big pipo inside di kontri n aim e be like say dem doncomeot mind wey make dem tok say di only way wey tocomet dia palava na for federal goment to find foreign assistance to fit tackle security kasala.
The main opposition political party in the country, the PDP, had also added voice in telling the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government at the centre that Nigeria needs external help to address the festering insecurity in the country.	Di opposition political parti inside di contri, PDP, join mouth put dey tell All Progressives Congress,APC we dey led say Nigeria need outside help to fit tackle security kasala wey don dis.
On his part, the immediate past President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, said President Muhammadu Buhari is overwhelmed by the security challenges, insisting that the federal government needs urgent help and must seek such without wasting time.	As e dey tok im own, di president  of senate wey just pass, Bukola Saraki say president  Muhammadu Buhari don dey taya ontop di security kasala, he de tanda say federal goment need sharpsharp help and make dem find am wit out nor waste time.
He also advised the president to bring together all former presidents and heads of state, serving and former chief justices, serving and former presiding officers of the National Assembly, serving and former heads of security agencies, traditional rulers with relevant experience, leaders of the private sector, development partners, friends of Nigeria in the international community and all others who can help in finding solutions to the problem at hand.	He also advise  di president  say make ekari all beforebefore president  and heads of state, beforebefore and nownow chief justices, serving and oga dem for National Assembly, beforebefore and nownow oga dem for security agencies, traditional rulers dem wey get experience wey good, oga for private sector dem, development partners, friends of Nigeria for internationalcomemunity wit odas wey fit find solution for dimata wey dey ground.
The ex-senate leader further called on the National Assembly to be more assertive in finding solutions to this issue of insecurity adding that the legislature would not be helping the Buhari administration if they did not become more insistent and decisive in their approach to getting the security crisis tackled immediately.	Dis beforebefore Senate president  still call di National Assembly say make dem find solution to di issue of insecurity as im add say di legislature nor gep dey help dis Buhari administration if dem nor add to dia tanda and decision for dia approach to take see di security palava tackle kiakia.
The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said that Nigeria needs unity to surmount the current security challenges, observing that every nation will go through difficult times and we must unite to succeed.	Di National Leader of di All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, say Nigeria need joinhand to tackle di security shallenge,dey tok say evri contri go pass tru hard time and we must dey united to take succeed.
He added that no president wants a country in chaos, noting that only a concerted and united response will end the numerous security challenges.	He had put say nor president  wan make kontri dey inside palava, e note say na only join hand response fit end dis plenty security kasala.
The best way is what we are doing; coming together to reduce banditry, to move for unity and be able to bring a better Nigeria to the people.	Di best way na wetin we dey do. Tocome togeda take reduce banditry, to move for unity and fit to  bring a beta Nigeria give pipo.
The welfare of our people is extremely important.	The welfare of awa  pipo dey very important.
And yes, every nation will go through these curves and difficult times.	And yes, everi contri go pass di hard and difficult time.
How we communicate it to the people, what are the areas to help make it easier for people to bear; those are ideas on how to be able to change the leadership of the country, he explained.	How we take dey tell am to pipo, na which area to take make am easy for pipo; na dem dat area on top how to fit change di leader for di contri; na im he tok.
The truth, however, is that the situation is not yet too bad as is being projected by many stakeholders.	The truth be say, mata neva spoil too spoil as many stakeholders take dey show am.
All hopes are not yet lost.	Hope neva lost finish.
This is not to say that they are not right in their observations and recommendations.	Di one nor be say dem nor dey right for wetin dem see and wetin dem tok.
The situation can be salvaged through collaboration with all stakeholders especially the traditional rulers, religious leaders, synergy among security agencies and the ability of the federal government to provide a level-playing field devoid of ethnic, religious or political interests.	We fit savage dimata wit colabo wit all stakeholders especiallyditraditional rulers dem, religious leaders,joinjoin among security pipo and for federal goment to fit provide solution of tribe abi political interest.
Time has come when the role of traditional rulers in peace keeping must be recognised at all levels.	Time doncome again wey be saydiwork of tradional ruler to make peace must dey recognized for every corner.
They are the custodians of the peoples culture and to some extent, their religion.	Na dem get culture of di pipo fo hand and dia religion to one place.
Traditional rulers, because of their closeness to the people, can play a great role in solving the security challenges if properly mobilised and engaged at local government, state and federal levels.	Traditional rulers becos of say dem dey close to di pipo, fit do big tin to take solve di security gbege if dem gather and follow dem tok wella from local goment go statecomerish federal.
If the traditional rulers at various localities across the country are fully engaged, they can  be the major source of information to the security agencies in terms of identifying any criminal elements lurking around their domains because they know who is who in those areas.	If dem follow traditional ruler dem for every angle for di state yarn wella, dem fit be di koko of wia  secutity pipo go dey get information as to take know criminal tin wey dey dia area because dem sabi dem wey dey di area
There is also the need for security agencies to work together in the fight against insecurity in the land.	E dey needed for security agencies to work together as to take fight insecurity for di land.
There must be a uniting force among them so that at any point one agency must not be away from what the other is doing to avoid not only duplication of duty but also to be on the alert based on information passed across various formations.	To joinhand must dey among dem so dat one side gocomeot ahnd from wetin d other side dey do to avoid to dey two work and to shine eyes put information wey dem sendcome from every angle.
The ugly incident that took place in Maiduguri some days ago where a fighter jet belonging to Nigerian Air Force bombed soldiers going to repel Boko Haram attack is a clear indication of lack of proper information and coordination among the two agencies.	The bad mata hapun for Maiduguri some days ago as fighting jet we be dem Nigeria Airforce own take bomb Nigeria Soldiers wey dem go double cross boko haram na mata we open say beta information and coordination between two agencies nor dey.
All the relevant agencies at the theater of war must be up and doing in information gathering and sharing among themselves to know when, where and how to strike when the enemy approaches or at most to, through such information, nip in the bud plans of such an enemy and prevent them from approaching not to talk of striking.	All di agencies wey be koko for war mata must dey gather tori and spread am to dia sef to take sabi wen, wia  and how enimies wan tackle wit di tori, dia plan go scatter and dem nor go fit attack not to tok of say dem go attack.
Religious leaders through their various organisations such as Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs, SCIA, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, among others, must also be engaged and enlightened on what to preach to their followers and how to monitor their activities.	Religious leaders tru dia various organisations like Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs, SCIA, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, and others must dey follow and eye open ontop wetin dem go preach give dia pipo and how to take follow follow dia ways. 
These men of God are respected by their followers to the extent that whatever they preach is always swallowed hook and sinker whether such utterances would cause chaos or not.	Dis men of God dem dey dey respect by dia piporish level say anything wey dem tok dem dey swallow go down whether di word go cause gbege or e nor go cause gbege.
They should be properly mobilised and sensitised on the dangers of wrong preaching that could pitch the various religious sects against each other.	Make dem mobilise dem well and sensitise dem on top danger wey dey for wrong preaching wey fit make one religion pipo dey fight di other.
Examples abound where crises have erupted from worship centres due to what the leaders must have told their followers to do, either to retaliate one perceived injustice or the other.	Examples deon dey wey be say wen palava start from place wey dem dey worship becos of wetin leaders dem tell dia pipo say make dem do, whether to fight back because of one injustice or  anoda one.
With proper sensitisation, such would not happen because they must have been educated on what to preach and what not to preach while with their followers.	Witi beta training, dat kai tin nor go hapun becos dem go don train dem ontop wetin dem go preach and wetin dem nor go preach for dia pipo.
It is pertinent to state here, however, that all these would come to nothing if government at all levels fail to provide a level-playing field for peace to reign.	E dey koko to tok am here say all dis nor gocome for vain if goment for every level nor bring wey for peace to dey.
Governments at all levels must strive to provide basic amenities that could engage the youths and take their minds away from crime.	Goment for every level must provide beta beta tins wey youths go dey do to takecomeot their mind from crime.
In trying to solve the security challenges, governments must always ensure that they do not take sides based on ethnic, religious or political differences when addressing issues of security breaches.	As to dey try solve security yawa, goment sef suppose see say dem nor do partial ontop tribe, religion or politics as dem dey try solve security kasala.
Perpetrators of crime must be treated equally according to laws of the land no matter who is involved.	Pipo wey do crime must dey treat disame disame as di law of di land we im dey take be.
A clear example of treating some criminals with kid gloves is the purported arrest of some operators of Bureau De Change in Kano that are allegedly sponsoring activities of Boko Haram insurgents.	Example of treating some criminals wit small hand na di arrest of some pipo wey dey do Bureau De Change for Kano wey dem say dem dey sponsor Boko Haram gbege.
Up till now, their identities have not been revealed which has had a negative effect on the fight against insurgency.	Till now, how dem be never dey open, wey dey get bad way ontop to fight crime.
Government must ensure that they are always in touch with the people especially at the grassroots level for them to know what it is doing about the present situation in the country in order not to allow rumours to thrive.	Goment must see say dem dey always get in touch wit pipo especially for di downdown for dem to sabi wetin bin dey hapun in di contri in oda not to gree for rumour to get power.  
With these, Nigeria will surely surmount the security challenge that has bedevilled her for over a decade now with much ease.	Witi dis one, Nigeria go fit bit di security kasala wey dey fight am for over 10 years wit easy.

With the incessant attacks between farmers and herders, state governments, mostly in the South, have resolved to ban open grazing and adopt ranching as an alternative to the age-long practice of herders roaming with their cattle to seek pasture for their herd.

What is ranching	Wetin be ranching
The National Geographic said ranching involves rearing livestock, especially cattle, on a vast area of land.	Di National Geographic pipo tok say ranching na to dey rear livestocks, especially cattle ontop big land
This activity, which is business oriented, enable livestock to graze in a controlled land for pastures, fodders and water provided for consumption through purchase of hays and growing of pasture.	This thing, weykari business sense go, go make livestocks dey chop for a land wey get control for grass and water  ontop contract and to dey plant grass
The practice is not a sedentary mode of grazing since the spacious land allows herders to walk around with their herd to consume grown fodder in a confined area.	This way nor dey function as grazing mode as chance dey for herdsmen to dey waka up and down wit dia cow to dey chop things wey dey any area wey dem go. 
However, growing fodder in the grazing area might not be sustainable as lack of rainfall or water to grow it would result in shortage.	But, to dey grow grass for area fit dey easy because rain shortage or water shortage nor go make am do well.
Overgrazing is another factor making it unsustainable.	Overgrazing sef dey among wetin nor go make am deyrish.

2023: Disquiet in Kwara APC over governors sister	2023: Wahala fo Kwara APC ontop governor sister.
The protracted leadership crisis rocking the Kwara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) took a new twist following calls for the removal of Senator Khairat Gwadabe, a sister to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, from the Membership Registration Appeal Panel set up by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee by some aggrieved founding members the party in the state.	Di teytey leadership palava wey dey hapun for Kwara  State chapter of di All Progressives Congress (APC) wear new cloth as dem some founding members wey dey vex open mouth say make dem comot  Senator Khairat Gwadabe, wey be sister to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, from di Membership Registration Appeal Panel Caretaker Committee wey Governor Mai Mala Buni dey lead.
The call for Khairats removal is coming on the heels of the fierce struggle for the control of the soul of the party in the state between the governor and some aggrieved leaders over the second term ticket for 2023 as the next electioneering campaign beckons.	Di call say make dem remove Khairat dey kom from di wahala of who go dey control di parti for di state between governor and some members wey dey vex ontop second term ticket for 2023 di next electioneering campaign beckons.
The governor and some notable leaders in the party have been at loggerheads since the administration came into power in 2019 in the state over disagreement in his style of leadership.	Di governor and some leader wey get mouth for di parti don dey digger something since dis tenure enta power in 2019 for di state ontop style wey im dey take rule. 
But despite some spirited efforts to bring everybody on the same page, according to insiders in the party, the issue appears to have festered, with the latest imbroglio having the potential to consume the party in the race for the top seat come 2023 if the needful is not done by uniting all the forces that collectively defeated the last Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration in the state, led by former Senate President Bukola Saraki.

For many members of the aggrieved group, which has the support of top party leaders like the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and his counterpart for transport (state), Gbemisola Saraki, under the factional caretaker chairman, Hon Bashiru Omolaja Bolarinwa (BOB), Khairats inclusion in the membership of the committee was part of a grand plan by the governor to hijack the party machinery in the state in the build-up to the 2023 elections.

Some of the top leaders and party supporters in the state, who said they had been disenfranchised from the registration/revalidation process, pointed accusing fingers at the former senator, who they accused of working with the Senator John Danbois committee which headed the last exercise in the state to disenfranchise leaders and members believed to be against the governor.

One of di press release weu yarn d mata small, one faction of di APC for di state believe say dem loyal to di camp of Lai Mohammed and other members wey dey vex, and tok am korokoro say dem nor want make dem add Senator Gwadabe join di 61-member committee.
The group, known as Integrity Group, in a statement signed by Comrade Abdul-Rahoof Bello, declared the appointment as unacceptable.	Di group wey pipo know as Integrity Group, inside on tok wey Comrade Abdul-Rahoof Bello sign yarn am kom outside dey dem nor acceptdiemployment.
According to the group, Here was a governors sister who worked in tandem with the Danboi committee to commit all sorts of atrocities and impunities against the partys interest in Kwara State.	As di group take talk, One governor sister dey do double mind  work wit didiDanboi committee to kos many wahala and some wuruwuru against watin di parti want for inside Kwara
Their call was echoed by another group believed to be fronting for the minister, Concerned APC Youth Stakeholders, which petitioned the national secretariat of the party as run by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) over the issue, alleging the over 600,000 of its members have been disenfranchised with the connivance of Senator Khairat.

Under the aegis of the Reformist Progressive Forum, the group that supports the governor, in a rejoinder to the statement by the Integrity Group, noted that Senator Gwadabes rejection by the group of political puppets in Kwara is baseless and unfounded.	Under di supporter for di Reformist Progressive Forum, di group wey dey support governor inside one quick reply to di statement of integrity group, tok say di rejection of Senator Gwadabe by group of political small pikin for kwara nor get head and norish tok.
This is unreasonable, illogical and destructive criticism.	Dis one nah mumu criticism wey nor get sense and fit destroy.
When contacted for comment, Saheed Popoola, a loyalist of the minister and lawmaker in the Kwara State House of Assembly from Offa, told Daily Trust Saturday that he was not in town.	When dem go meet am for tori, Saheed Popoola, one of di pipo wey dey loyal wella todiminister and im still be lawmaker for Kwara State House of Assembly from Offa, tell Daily Trust Saturday say im nor dey town.
But a top member of the party and diehard supporter of the minister from Kwara Central said although Alhaji Lai Mohammed and few others registered despite condemnation of the exercise, the action was in demonstration and solidarity with prominent national leaders of the party like Chief Bisi Akande and Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who did but still faulted the process, calling for improvement.

Di action na to demo and to show we dey wit you give big big leaders dem for di parti like Chief Bisi Akande and Bola Ahmed Tinubu wey still tok say di process dey wonkain, make dem do am well.
But on the issue of how this might affect the partys chances in 2023, the top party official said, There is still a long way to go, and many considerations may be laid on the table before then.	But ontopmata on how di tin fit take affect di parti chance for 2023, dem Oga for di parti say; dimata long gan-an and dem fit put manymata ontop table before dat time. 
Our workings now are first to get the sham which the last exercise clearly was upturned and get the national leadership to approve the conduct of a fresh exercise in the state.	Our workings now na to first get di wayo wey bend di last exercise and to get di hand of National leader dem to do fresh exercise for di state.
For Kunle Suleiman, a lawyer and pioneer chairman of the PDP in the state and an unrepentant apologist of the governor, what is happening is politics and the party will rise above it when the time comes.

He, however, said their concern was how to deliver good governance, which the governor promised.	Im still tok say dia konsain na  how dem go take make life beta wey di governor promise dem.

In politics, and where you have factions, this type of thing happens.	For inside politices wey many factions dey, dis kain tin dey hapun.
Somebody that is not given something always complains; and those complaining now belong to BOB and Lais group.	Person wey dem nor give somtin go complain; and pipo wey dey complain be BOB and Lai group.
They thought they could control the registration exercise and party politics but now realised that it has suddenly moved out of their hands.	Dem think say dem fit controldiregistration exercise and parti politics but now kom see say e don comot for dia hand.
They are complaining because they lost in the partys power game for now, he added.	Dem dey complain because dem don lost for di power game of di parti now. E add join.
He, however, said the party would get its acts together in the remaining two years, adding, We came to the APC in factions.	He kom tok say di parti go get im sef for inside dis two years wey remain as im still add say  We kom inside APC faction faction
These same people that are saying the governor will not get the ticket also said so during his first term and did not vote for him, yet he got it; and he will get it again.	Dis same pipo wey say di governor nor go get ticket still tok like dat for im first time and dem nor vote for am, e still get am; and e go get am again.
It is about strategy and getting your politics right.	Na ontop make you use sense and get your politics koret.

Also, the issue of the governors kind of politics has been at the centre of the present disagreement, with notable figures like Professor Abdulraheem Shuaib Oba and Akogun Iyiola Oyedepo describing him as a featherweight politician that could be easily discarded in 2023.

In the view of some political watchers, what has played out in the way the governor has dealt with Lais group and how he handled the registration exercise only indicate how things could get complicated in the struggle to control the party ahead of 2023.	For di eyes of some pipo wey sabi watch politics, watin don hapun ontop how governor take deal wit Lai group and how e take handle di registration exercise show how mata fit no take get head to control di parti  before 2023.

It is a legume known for its high nutritious value.	Na legume wey get high nutritious value.
Our agric editor who has been monitoring the soya bean value-chain reports that despite the fact that Nigeria is said to be the largest producer of the crop in Africa, its production level has not attained its full capacity.	Awa agric editor wey don dey monitor di soya bean value-chain tok say, even say dem know Nigeria as di largest producer of soya for Afrika, di production level still neva reach im full capacity.
This is because soya bean farming in the country is still largely done by small farmers who grow the crop as a minor crop alongside major crops like maize, cowpea (beans) and cassava.	Dis na becos most of dose wey dey plant soya bean for di kontri be small farmers. Dem no dey plant am as di main crop, but dem dey use am support oda major crops like corn, cowpea (beans) and cassava.

Best ways to farm soya bean	Di best way wey we fit take use farm soya bean
According to a long time soya bean farmer, Dr Awoniyi Joseph, planting of soya bean usually starts in June, and that it grows well on all kinds of soil, except deep soils with poor water retention.	Accordin to a long time soya bean farmer, Dr Awoniyi Joseph, soya bean planting dey always start for June, and e dey grow well on all type of soil, except deep soil wey no fit hold water.
Dr Joseph informed farmers that an important factor to consider when embarking on soya bean farming in Nigeria was rainfall.	Dr Joseph yarn farmers say one important tin to consider wen pesin wan start soya bean farming for Nigeria na rainfall.
He said Nigeria had a very favourable climatic condition that was ideal for soya bean to flourish.	E tok say Nigeria get very gud climate wey dey perfect for soya bean to flourish.
According to him, good harvest depends mostly on adequate irrigation as the crop can also be grown in areas with lesser amounts of rainfall through irrigation.	As Awoniyi tok, gud harvest depend mostly on regular irrigation, becosthroughirrigation, di crop fit grow for areas wey no get plenti rainfall.
According to IITA, soya bean should not be planted in sandy, gravelly, or shallow soils to avoid drought stress, advising that it should not be grown in waterlogged soils or soils with surfaces that can crust, as this will lead to poor seedling emergence	Accordin to IITA, make dem no plant soya bean for sandy, gravelly, or shallow soils to prevent drought stress, dem advise say make dem no plant am for soil wey get plenty water or soil wit surfaces wey fit break, cos dis no go make di seed komot well. 
Clear all vegetation before land preparation.	Clear all di plants wey dey, befor u prepare di land.
The seedbed may be prepared manually with a hoe or an animal-drawn implement or tractor, IITA advised.	U fit prepare di seedbed manually wit a hoe or animal-drawn equipment or tractor, IITA advise.
Well-prepared land ensures good germination and reduces weed infestation.	Land wey dem prepare well dey allow di seed germinate well, and e dey reduce weed infestation.
You can plant on ridges or on a flat seedbed, the IITA added.	IITA add am join say; U fit plant on ridges or on flat seedbed.
Experts warn that soya bean variety selection should be based on maturity, yield potential, lodging, drought tolerance and resistance to pests and diseases.	Experts don warn say to choose di type of soya bean wey u go plant, u need look at di period wey e dey take mature, di yield potential, lodging, and how well e fit tolerate drought and resist pest and disease.
John Stephen, a soya bean farmer in Garam, a Niger State community neighbouring the FCT, insisted that the maturity period should be the first consideration when choosing a variety suited to your geographical zone.	John Stephen, wey be soya bean farmer for Garam, one community for Niger State, close to di FCT, insist say na di maturity period u need to consida first wen u wan choose di type of soya bean wey fit ur location.
Stephen advised that, Consider varieties that are earlier maturing rather than late maturing in areas with low rainfall.	Stephen advise say, for areas wey get low rainfall, make u consida di seed wey dey mature early rada dan di one wey dey mature late.
Although later maturity increases the yield potential, it is risky to grow late maturing varieties in drier environments because of late season drought.	Although seed wey dey mature late dey always get beta yield, but e dey risky to plant late maturing seed for dry environments becos of late season drought.
IITA advised farmers to use high quality seeds of the selected variety as soya bean seeds easily lose their viability.	IITA advise farmers say make di type of seed wey dem go choose be of high quality becos soya bean seeds dey quick lose dia viability.
According to the institute, it is common for soya bean, even when stored properly, not to germinate after 12 to 15 months in storage.	According to di institute, e dey common for soya bean not to grow afta 12 to 15 monts wey e don dey for storage, even wen dem keep am well.
Therefore, use seeds that are not more than 12 months old to ensure good germination.	So, make u use seed wey never pass 12 monts so e go fit germinate well.
Sort out the good seeds for planting to ensure that they are free from insects, disease infestation and weed seeds.	Select di gud seed komot for planting so u go fit make sure say dem no get insect, disease, or weed seeds.
Do not purchase seeds from the open market as the germination potential is not guaranteed.	Make u no buy seed from open market, cos di ability for di seed to germinate no guarantee.
Planting poor quality seeds will not produce a good yield,	Planting seed wey get poor quality no go produce beta yield.

A total count of 320 germinated seeds or more indicates a germination rate of 80 percent and above.	If u fit count a total of 320 seeds wey germinate, e mean say di germination rate of di seed na 80 percent and above.
When the percentage of germination is 80 percent or less, the seed rate has to be increased accordingly to achieve 100 percent.	Wen di percentage of germination na 80 percent or less, u go need increase di seed rate to achieve 100 percent.
Fertiliser application	Fertiliser application
IITA advises that a good fertiliser recommendation for soya bean production depends on a good soil test.	IITA advise say to recommend beta fertiliser for soya bean production, pesin go need to do a gud soil test.
Under normal conditions, soya bean as a legume should provide itself with nitrogen through biological nitrogen fixation.	For normal kondition, soya bean as legume wey e be suppose provide esef wit nitrogenthroughbiological nitrogen fixation.
Until nodulation occurs, the soya bean plant depends on soil nitrogen for growth.	Until nodulation don happun, di soya bean plant go dey depend on di soil nitrogen to grow.
Phosphorus is often the most deficient nutrient, therefore, apply optimum phosphorous fertiliser for good yield.	Phosphorus na im di plant dey lack pass, derefor, make u put di best phosphorous fertiliser so e go fit grow well.

Make we no mention sorghum wey account for 50% of di total cereal wey dem produce and e occupy about 45% of di total land area wey dem devote for cereal production
Add to these, the millions of tons of grasses on fallow land and open range.	Make we add to diz, di million ton of grass wey dey fallow land and open range
To access these fodders, which are mainly available only in situ, cattle must move and openly graze.	To access diz fodder dem, wey dey always dey available only for situ, cattle go move and dem go dey openly gaze
In most cases, this is done with the expressed permission of farmers for a fee.	for many case, dem go pay farmer and take permission before dem do am
This explains why a kilo of beef sells for 1700 Naira.	Na diz touchlight why kilo of beef dey sell for N1700
Therefore, until the country has a programme to process these quality fodders, banning open grazing will be a dog in the manger policy.	Until di kontri get ways wey dem fit process di fodder dem, banning open grazing no fit apun
But I accept that rogue elements amongst herders engage in criminalities and the justice system has failed to prosecute them.	But I know say some wayo pipo wey dey among herder dem dey engage for criminal things and justice system no see dem prosecute

6 NIPP plants, 22 new substations added to power grid in 6 years Report	dem don add 6 NIPP plant dem, 22 new substation for di power grid wey dey 6 years report.
Generation Companies (GenCos) and 22 power substations built and operated between 2015 and now, have significantly driven improvement on the national electricity grid to the 5,800 megawatts (MW) highest peak energy recorded in March 2021.	Generation companies (GenCos) and 22 power substation wey dem build and dey operate between 2015 and now, don make improvement dey for di national eletcricity grid to di 5,800 megourtt wey be di highest peak energy wey dem record for March 2021.
This is according to the latest NIPP report on power projects execution since 2015, obtained from the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) by Daily Trust.	Dis dey according to di latest NIPP report on top power project execution since 2015, wey Daily trust obtained from di Niger Delta power holding company (NDPHC).
The NIPP is an intervention vehicle warehoused in NDPHC and owned by the federal, state and local governments.	Di NIPP na di intervention vehicle warehouse wey di federal, state and local goment own for NDPHC.
In 2015, the power grid hovered between 4,500 megawatts (MW) enabled by the commissioning and utilisation of the Geregu, Omotosho, Olorunsogo, Alaoji, Calabar and Ihovbor NIPP GenCos	For 2015, di power grid don dey between 4,500 megourtts (MW) wey don bikom useful by di commissioning and utilisation of Geregu, Omotosho, Olorunshogo, Alaoji, calabar, Ihovbor NIPP GesCos
that added nearly 1,000MW to the grid.	Dat one add nearly 1,000MW
However, the grid continued to rise with all-time peak electricity reaching 5,801.60MW as of March 2021, according to the statistics from the Independent System Operations (ISO) arm of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).	Howeva, di grid continue to dey rise wit all-time peak electricity wey don reach 5,801.60MW as of March 2021, according to di statistics wey we get from independent system operation (ISO) arm of di Transmission company of Nigeria. (TCN)
NDPHC started the NIPP intervention with the first phase in power generation.	NDPHC don start di NIPP intervention wit di first phase wey dey power generation.
It began to build 10 power GenCos known as the 'The Big Ten' around gas-producing states including Ondo, Ogun, and Kogi states.	E don begin dey build 10 power GenCos wey dem dey call ' The Big Ten' around gas-producing state dem wey include Ondo, Ogun, and Kogi states.
However, until 2015, some of them were still ongoing.	Howeva, work still dey go on dem till 2015
The second phase was then launched from 2015 to include intervention projects focusing on transmission, distribution, and renewable energy towards meeting NDPHC mandate of Lighting the Nation.	Dem lunch the second phase for 2015 to include intervention project, wey go focus on transmission, distribution, and energy wey dem don renew towards meeting NDPHC mandate for lighting di nation.
Currently, there are six power GenCos producing about 3,400MW electricity in the national grid while the four other GenCos are ongoing.	currently, dem bin dey six power GenCos wey dey produce about 3,400MW electricity for di national grid while di four oda GenCos dey ongoing.
Even among the four, some of its turbines have been commissioned and operational since 2015.	Even among di four, some of im turbines don dey commission and dey operational since 2015.
Analysis of the report indicates that the NIPP intervention in the transmission section of the power sector value chain, NDPHC has completed 22 substations comprising 10 units of 330/132 kilovolts (kV) level and 12 units of 132/33kV substations.	Explanation of di report show say di NIPP intervention for di transmission section wey dey di power sector value di chain, NDPHC don complete 22 substations wey bin dey compromise 10 units of 330/132 kilovolts (KV) level and 12 units of 132/33KV  substations.
It has also completed 2,194 kilometres of 330kV power transmission line and 887km of 132kV transmission lines.	E don also complete 2,194 kilometres wey dey 330KV power transmission line and 887km wey dey 132KV transmission lines.
These infrastructures since 2015, have added 5,590MVA energy supply capacity at the 330kV level and 3,793MVA at the 132kV level.	Dis infracstructure since 2015, don add  5,590MVA energy supply capacity wey dey 330KV level and 3,793MVA wey dey 132KV level.
To promote renewable and clean energy, the NIPP in the second phase became a major driver of the federal government's energy mix by 2030 known as Vision 30-30-30) which seeks to make renewable energy to be at least 30 per cent of the energy grid by 2030.	To promote energy wey dey clean and improve, di NIPP for di second phase don turn to major driver of di federal goment energy mix by 2030 wey dem dey call vision 30-30-30 wich seek energy wey go improve to at least 30 percent of di energy grid by 2030.
While it has installed 20,000 Solar Home Systems (SHS) in some northern states, the NIPP is delivering a huge part of the ongoing five million SHS to households nationwide under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP).	While e don install 20,000 solar home systems for some northen states, di NIPP don dey deliver a huge part of the ongoing five million SHS to domot nationwide under di Economic Sustainability plan (ESP).
There is also intervention in the gas sector towards solving the major challenges of the power plants which is the availability of gas-to-power.	Dia bin dey intervention for di gas sector wey go solve major challenge of di power plant wich be di availability of gas-to-power.
According to the Managing Director of NDPHC, Mr Chiedu Ugbo, in an interview with Daily Trust, the company is achieving this through the Fuel & Gas/Public Private Partnership (PPP) model.	According to di oga patapata for NDPHC, Mr Chiedu Ugbo, for interview wey im get with Daily Trust,di company dey achieve dis tru di fuel and gas or public private partnership model.
It created a department for this to spearhead its gas pipelines and feed stock connecting all the 10 NIPP GenCos.	E don create a department for dis to spearhead im gas pipeline and feed stock wey dey connect all di 10 NIPP GenCon.
In terms of power distribution, the report said the NIPP intervention has seen the completion of over 360 NIPP injection substations with a combined capacity of about 3,540MW.	wen dem tok power distribution, di report tok say di NIPP intervention bin don see di completion of ovr 360 NIPP injection substations wit a combined capacity wey reach 3,540 MW.
To complement these substations, NDPHC has also built about 2,600km of 11kV power distribution lines and 4600km of 33kV distribution lines which directly supply electricity to transformers in residential areas.	To complement dis substations, NDPHC don build about 2,600KM of 11KV power distribution lines and 4600KM of 33KM distribution lines wey dey supply electricity directly to transformer
There have also been 296 Appropriated Distribution Projects, which included injection substations, 1924 of 33kV lines, 4600km of 11kV line and other infrastructure.	Dia bin dey 296 appointed project wey dem don distribute, wich injection substations dey inside, 1924 of 33kv lines, 4600km of 11kv lines wit dem oda infastruction 
NDPHC has also increased its distribution capacity with the installation of 25,900 Completely Self-Protected (CSP) transformers across the country, added Mr Ugbo.	NDPHC sef don increase im distribution capacity wit di installation of 25,900 completely self-protected (CSP)  transformer wey dey across obodo, nah Mr Ugbo add dis one. 
In spite of these achievements that have helped to improve the national grid operations, the report highlighted threats to the infrastructure especially at the power distribution level.	On top all dis achivement wey don help to improve di operation of national grid, di report highlight threat to di infastructure especially for di one wey dey di power distribution level.
Some of the challenges NDPHC has met in distribution include theft of equipment and infrastructure, vandalism, lack of cooperation from Distribution Companies (DisCos).	Some of di wahala wey NDPHC dey see for dis distribution be say dem dey tif dia equipment and infrastructure, vandalism, and lack of cooperation from Distribution companies (DisCos
The others are community issues regarding land and Right of Way (ROIs), vehicular accidents that have damaged some power infrastructure and the rising insecurity across facility areas, it stated 	Di oda nah community wahala wey dey regard land and Right of way ( ROIs), motor accident wey don damage some power infrastructure and rising insecurity wey dey facility areas, e start
In a comment to evaluate the viability of the NIPP interventions to Nigerian electricity consumers, the President, Nigeria Consumer Protection Network (NCPN), Barrister Kunle Kola Olubiyo, said the essence of the power sector privatization exercise concluded in November 2013 was to promote competitive economy and inclusive growth by private sector drivers.	for a comment wey go empty di property of di NIPP intervention to Nigerian wey dey comsume electricity, di President for di Nigeria consumer Protection Network ( NCPN), Barrister Kunle Kola Olubiyo, im tok say di reason for di power sector privatatization exercise wey dem conclude for November 2013 hapen to promote competitive economy and inclusive growth by 
He however said despite this, the sector has not attained such viability, and so there was the need for the government to deepen the interventions through NIPP.	Im howeva tok say despite dis, di sector neva reach dat kin viability, so di goment need to deepen di interventions tru NIPP.
In spite of all the tremendous milestone achievements by NIPP/NDPHC, there are major areas of impediments on the full realisation of the lofty ideals of NIPP as championed by the management of NDPHC.	On top all di tremendous milestone wey NIPP/NDPHC don achieve, dia bin major area of impediment wey dey full realizeation of di lofty idea wey di management of NDPHC championed.
Mr Olubiyo said some of these challenges include the delay in taking over projects by the DisCos which should be captured in their Capital Expenditure (CAPEX).	Mr Olubiyo tok say di wahala dem dey face include delay in taking over projects by di DisCos wich dem suppose capture for dia capital Expenditure ( CAPEX)
He also said the delay in the implementation of the Eligible Customers regulation by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) was a hindrance.	Im continue im tok say nah di Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) bin di inderance for di delay in di implementaion of di regulations of eligeable consumer
With the huge power assets that NIPP has provided, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and other dedicated power users can decide to connect to the NIPP plants and facilities directly and enjoy uninterrupted power supply, but this is being delayed.	wit di kin huge power assets wey NIPP don provide, di Manufacturers Association of Nigeria ( MAN) and oda dedicated power users fit decide to connect to di NIPP plants and facilities directly and dey enjoy uninterrupted power supply, but dis bin dey delay.
Another challenge for the NDPHC is funding, which according to him, should be raised by the equity stakeholders (federal, state and local governments) for more power sector projects.	Anoda wahala wey NDPHC dey get nah funding, wich im think say di equity stakeholders suppose raise for more power sector projects.
The leadership of the power sector will also need to address the low tariff for NIPP Plants and the low load (energy) dispatch of the available units from TCN.	Di leadearship of di power sector go need to address di low tariff wey dey NIPP plants and di low load (Energy) dispatch wey dey available units from TCN
Consumers are looking for more electricity, why should energy from NIPP GenCos be restricted?	Consumer dem dey look for more electricity, why energy from NIPP GenCos con dey restricted ?
Olubiyo queried.	Nah so Olubiyo ask.
Unlike elsewhere, Ramadan season in Nigeria has unfortunately been turned into a season of unnecessary controversy.	unlike oda places, Ramadan season for Nigeria don unfortunately turn into a season wey dey get unnecessary controversy
Starting from the recurrent controversy over the advent of the Ramadan crescent that ushers in the month and the exit of its moon that marks its end,	Di controvercy don start from di arrival of di Ramadan crescent wey dey usher in di new month and di moon go waka commot to show e end. 
the Ramadan period equally witnesses controversy over ideological, jurisprudential or political stances expressed by some Ulama in the course of their Quranic tafseer sessions.	di Ramadan peroid dey equally witness controversy ova ideological, jurisprudential or political stances wey some Ulama expressed for di course of dia Quranic trfseer sessions
Yet, over the past couple of years, there has been unnecessary controversy over which charitable deed between sponsoring the broadcast of Quranic tafseer and charitable mass feeding for the needy is more worthwhile in Ramadan.	ova many many years, dia bin don dey unnecessary controversy ova say wich charitable work better pass between make dem dey suponsor broadcast Quranic tafseer abi make dem dey do charitable mass feeding of di needy for Ramadan. 
As in other Muslim societies, Ramadan usually inspires a phenomenal rise in individual and societal spirituality in Nigeria where many wealthy individuals sponsor live or recorded broadcasts of Quranic tafseer by various Ulama.	As e dey go for oda Muslim societies, Ramadan dey always inspire a phenomenal risefor individual and for societal spirituality for Nigeria wer plenty  wealthy pipo dey sponsorlive or recorded broadcast for Quranic tafseer by different Ulama
Many others also spend more on charitable mass feeding for the poor.	Many oda pipo dey spend more on top charitable feeding of di poor.
However, while almost, if not all, who sponsor the broadcast of tafseer do also spend on charitable feeding, not all who spend on charitable feeding sponsor the broadcast of tafseer.	Howeva, while almost, if no be all, who dey sponsor di broadcast tafseerb dey spend for di charitable feeding too, no be all wey dey spend for charitable feeding dey suponsor di broadcast of tafseer.
During Ramadan in a typical northern Nigerian city, television and radio stations make a killing with the sale of airtime for tafseer and other religious lectures sponsored by individuals, firms and groups.	Ramadan period for northern Nigeria, television and radio stations dey make profit wit di sale of airtime for tafseer and oda religious lectures wey individual, firms and groups sponsor
From the sheer number of sponsored broadcasts of tafseer and other religious lectures on the more than 10 radio stations in Kano, for instance, one may wonder whether they do other programmes in Ramadan.	from di kin number of sponsor broadcast of tafseer an dem oda religious lecture wey dey for like 10 radio stations for Kano, for example, one fit begin dey wonda weda dem dey do oda programme for Ramadam period. 
Now, while sponsoring tafseer broadcast is absolutely worthwhile, especially during Ramadan, the amount of resources spent in this regard might be disproportionate considering the desperate need for food that the largely hunger-stricken audiences are languishing in.	E good say dem dey sponsor tafseer broadcast, especially for Ramadan, di amount wey dem dey spend for dis regard be like say im dey imbalance if we consider di kin hunger wey dey wire di needy 
After all, given the choice, they would certainly choose food handouts over such sponsored broadcasts as public tafseer sessions are everywhere during Ramadan for one to choose which to attend.	afta all, if dem get chance to choose, dem go certainly choose food hangout ova dat kin sponsored broadcast, as e don be say public tafseer session dey evriwia for Ramadan wey persin fit choose wich to attend.
Besides, looking at the underlying dynamics and politics of sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast, one cannot rule out Riyaa, sectarian and even political interests as some of the motives behind sponsoring the broadcast of some tafseer and other religious lectures.	Besides, di kin underlying dynamics and politics wey dey for sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast, persin no fit rule out Riyaa, sectarian and even political interest wey be di main motives for di sponsor of tafseer and dem oda religious lectures.
Interestingly, while some sponsors compete in sponsoring the broadcast of tafseer by some prominent Ulama, some Ulama sponsor the broadcast of their own tafseer in the absence of a willing sponsor; others even beg for sponsors to sponsor theirs.	Wetin dey interesting be say, while some sponsor dey compete for who go sponsor di broadcast of tafseer wey some prominent Ulama dey anchor, some of di Ulama dey sponsor dia own broadcast tafseer even if dem no see persin wey wan sponsor;  odas even dey beg for sponsor wey go sponsor dia programme.
Also, as the contents of some tafseer and other religious lectures feature some serious flaws, sponsoring their broadcast is a gross misplacement of priority.	Also, di content wey some tafseer and oda religious lectures dey feature get some serious flaws, to dey sponsor dis kin broadcast nah big misplacement of priority
Equally interesting, others sponsor the broadcast of Adhan (Kiran Sallah) in a city like Kano	anoda thing wey dey interesting be say, some dey sponsor di broadcast of Adhan ( Kiran sallah) for inside city like Kano. 
where, thanks to the sheer proliferation of mosques, regular Adhan reaches every nook and cranny.	wia, thank you to sheer wey dey increase for Mosques, regular Adhan don dey reach evri corner 
Anyway, while Ikhlas is always the most fundamental yardstick that determines the worthwhileness or otherwise of both charitable feeding and the sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer broadcast, striking an appropriate balance between the two guarantees the perfect outcome.	Anyway, Ikhlas bin di ogbonge yardstick way dey determine if weda charitable feeding and di sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer  broadcast dey worthy or not, striking appropriate balance between di two go give better outkom.
Because as much as Ramadan is the month of the Quran when Muslims are expected to be particularly committed to it in terms of reading, learning its meanings and living accordingly,	Even though say Ramadan be di month of di Quran wey be say Muslims suppose dey commited in terms of reading, learning wetin im mean and to dey live dia lives accordingly
it's equally the month of generous charity when Muslims, particularly the wealthy, are expected to do much more in terms of charitable works especially mass feeding.	Di month nah di month of generous charity wey be say Muslims, particularly di ones wey dey wealthy suppose dey do charity work, especially mass feeding.
However, while that's simply the bottom line, which also explains why the controversy is absolutely unnecessary, the so-called liberal Muslims have blown it out of proportion.	Howeva, while dat one com be di bottom line, wich explain why di controversy no dey necessary, di Liberal Musilims don over do am
Capitalizing on public frustration amid the unbearable hunger ravaging the largest segment of the society, they question the worthwhileness and relevance of sponsoring the broadcast of Ramadan tafseer under the prevailing circumstances.	capitalizing on top public frustration wey dey inside di hunger wey dey wire di society, dem dey kwesion weda di sponsoring of di broadcast Ramadan tafseer dey worthy or relevance for under dis kin condition wey we dey find ourselves.
Also, feigning empathy and concern, they address the two charitable works as though mutually exclusive and thus people should choose between them.	As dem don pretend show empathy and concern, dey tok say di two charity work be di same and make pipo choose between dem.
Unsurprisingly, and under the pressure of the hard conditions, many people, including many otherwise discerning folks, fell for that propaganda not realising its context, which is the raging face-off between the so-called liberal Muslims, on the one hand, who are hell-bent on undermining Islamic and moral values in the society, and the wholehearted Muslims, on the other, especially the Ulama among them who are committed to encouraging people to never neglect their religious commitments in pursuit of their legitimate worldly pursuits.	Under di hard condition wey pipo dey, e no surprise to dey see many pipo, including di ones wey fit discern, fall for di propaganda wey dem no know e context, nah im be di raging face-off wey dey between di Liberal Muslims, for anoda side, dem bin wan undermine Islamic and moral values for di society by force, togada with di
Also, contrary to their claim, such so-called liberal Muslims aren't actually disturbed by the plight of the vulnerable, which explains why they never urge those spending huge resources on other things, no matter how absolutely worthless, to divert the resources to charitable courses.	Also, contrary to wetin dem claim, di Liberal Muslims no dey disturb by di kin wahala wey dey for di vulnerable, dis don explain why dem neva urge those wey dey spend huge resources on top oda things, no mater how worthless im be, make dem divert di resources to charitable course.
Likewise, they never urge that the massive amounts of resources their elite role models spend on maintaining their extravagant lifestyles should be diverted to the feeding of the poor or sheltering them.	Dem neva urge dat di kin massive amounts of  resources dia elite role spend on top say dey wan maintain dia big lifestyles suppose dey diverted for di feeding of di poor or to take give dem shelter 
Instead, their conscience comes alive only when the resources are meant for, say, Hajj, Umrah, Daawah etc.	Instead, dia conscience go kom alive wen resources dey for only, say, Hajj, Umrah, Daourh

The best part of that part, is that none of those friendships, new or old, are coloured by religion or ethnicity.	The best part be say, all dis friend dem weda new or old, no dey base on religion or ethnicity

Taming Nigerias oil spillage and gas flaring scourge	To tame Nigeria oil spillage and gas flarin scourge
By Jerome-Mario Utomi	E kom from Jerome Mario-Utami
The recent news report that the Okordia-Rumekpe 14-inch crude truck line operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) discharged some 213 barrels of crude oil into the Ikarama community in Bayelsa, has again brought to our consciousness that though Nigeria prides itself as the giant of Africa and the most populous black nation in the world, yet, it is still riddled with third world challenges.	Di recent news report say Okordia-Rumekpe 14-inch crude truck line wey Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) dey operate discharge 213 barrel crude oil for Ikarama community for Bayelsa don reach awa side say though Nigeria wey been dey proud say dey be giant of Africa and di black kontri wey get pipo pass for di world stil dey get plenti third world kasala
Essentially, while clarifying that an estimated 1.34 hectares of land was polluted by the leakage, which followed a rupture on the pipeline, SPDC among other things confirmed that probe into the incident had been concluded, noting that out of the 213 barrels of SPDCs bonny light crude stream leak, some 110 barrels are recoverable from the ongoing recovery exercise at the site, leaving an estimated spilled volume at 109.12 barrels.	As dem dey clarify say na like 1.34 hectare land dem pollute wit di leakage wey rupture for di pipeline follow, SPDC confirm say dey finish di investigation of di incident, dey tok say out of 213 of SPDC bonny light crude leak, na like 110 barrel dem see recover for di recovery exercise wey dem dey do for di site, e kom remain 109.12 barrel of di volume wey spill.
Admittedly, these claims by the Dutch oil giant are verifiable facts but may not be the only explanation.	Admittedly, wetin Dutch oil giant claim na fact wey dem fit verify but e fit no be di only explanation
Their clarification notwithstanding, there are indeed reasons that qualify such happening in Nigerias oil and gas industry as a reality that demands holistic analysis.	Notwitstandin dia clarification,reasons dey wey qualify dis kind apunin for Nigeria oil and gas industry as reality wey dey suppose analyse generally
Lets begin with reality.	Make we start wit reality
Aside from the awareness that spillage occurs, communal rights to a clean environment and access to clean water supplies are violated in such cases and the oil industry, by its admission, has abandoned thousands of polluted sites in the region, which needs to be identified and studied in details while communities adversely affected are adequately compensated for their losses, this latest spill is coming weeks after a similar one from a ruptured pipeline facility managed by one of the International Oil Companies operating in the Niger Delta that reportedly ravaged Benikrukru and adjourning communities in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State.	Aside from di awareness say spillage dey happen, communal right for environment wey clean and access for clean water supply na hin dey don violate for dat kind case, wit dia admission, dey don abandon thousands of site wey dey don pollute for di region, wey dem nid identify and study for detail as dey compensate di community wey e affect well for dia loss wella, dis lastest spill apun weeks afta one wey resemble am for one pipeline facility wey rupture wey one International Oil company wey dey  operate for Niger Delta dey manage, wey dem report say destroy Benikrukru and commuinty wey dey around am for Warri South-west local goment Area for Delta state.
And another in the early hours of Sunday, March 14, 2021, at Polobubo/Opuama Communities, Warri North Local Government Area of the state, could settle.	And anoda one for early momo on Sunday, March 14,2021 for Polubobu / Opuama, Warri North local Goment Area for di state, go fit settle.
Such litany of spillages also include but not limited to, namely; the historic large scale spillages in places such as the Ogoni Land, Rivers State and the Erovie community in Ozoro, Isoko North Local Government of Delta State 1990s, both in the Nigerias South South geopolitical zones, of which their negative impacts linger.	Dis kind big scale set of spillage also include but e no dey limited to; di big spillage wey dey history for place like Ogini land, Rivers State and Erovie community for Ozoro, Isoko North Local Goment for Delta state for 1990s, di two for Nigeria south south zone and negative impact still dey der.
Are these the only explanations/examples?	Shey na di only explanation /example dem be dis?
The answer is a definite	Di answer na ogbonge
no, as there exist yet	no, as oda ones dey
other critical reasons/concerns why we should view the situation as a crisis.	Oda critical reason / concern dem why we suppose see di situation as crisis.
First and very fundamental is the inability of Nigeria and Nigerians to appreciate and treat crude oil spillage and environmental pollution resulting from exploration/crude oil production related activities as a national calamity.	Di first and veri important na di inability of Nigeria and hin pipo to appreciate and treat activity wey relate to crude oil spillage and environment pollution wey dey kom from exploration/crude oil production as national calamity
The second is the stunning consciousness that gas flaring/environmental degradation resulting from crude oil prospecting/production-related activities in the country is under reported.	Di second na di stunnin conciousness wey gas flarin/ environment degradation dey apun bikos of activities wey dey related to crude oil prospectin/ production for di kontri dey under-reported.
This second concern stems from a recent comment, which according to media report was credited to the Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, who stated that findings by his agency showed that an average of five oil spills was recorded daily in Nigeria.	Dis second concern dey kom from one recent comment, wey be say from media report na from di Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, wey tok say wetin hin agency find show say average of five oil spills na hin Nigeria dey record evriday.
Musa, who spoke to journalists in Abuja, said, In 2018 we had about 600 oil spill incidents and in 2019, we had over 700 oil spill-impacted sites across the country.	Musa, wey follow journalists tok for Abuja, tok say for 2018, we get 600 oil spill incident and for 2019, we get about 700 oil spill-impacted site actross di kontri.
This wakeful comment becomes even more relevant to the present discourse when one remembers that Nigeria according to reports is dotted with about 139 gas flare locations spread across the Niger Delta both in onshore and offshore oil fields where gas which constitutes about 11 percent of the total gas produced are flared.	Dis comment wey dey open brain dey more important for wetin we dey discourse if pesin remember say Nigeria accordin to report don get about 139 place wey gas don flare across Niger Delta both for di oil fields wey dey water and di one wey no dey, wer gas wey dey flare dey reach 11% of evrithin wey dem dey produce.
More than anything else, it brings to mind the questions as to; what exactly impedes the development of the petroleum sector and Niger Delta region?	Pass anything, na di question dem wey e bring kom mind be; wetin dey stop di development of petroleum sector and Niger Delta region
Are there no legislative works?	Shey Legislative work no dey?
Why is such a legislative framework not providing a strong source of remedy for individuals and communities negatively affected by oil exploration and production in the coastal communities?	Why dis kind legislative framework no dey provide strong source of solution for pipo and community wey oil exploration and production affect badly for coastal comminity dem?
If these frameworks exist, why is it not effective and enforceable?	If dis framework dey, why e no dey work or make dem do am?
Is the framework as comprehensive as a legal solution to the issues of oil-related violations?	Shey di framework get evrithin  like legal solution for di issues of violations wey relate to oil?
Why has the nation not learned a valid lesson from the Dutch government where all operators are required to restore their areas of operation back to how nature intended?	Why di nation neva learn serious lesson from Dutch goment wia all di pipo wey dey operate must restore wia dem dey operate back to how dey meet am?
Regardless of what others may say, the truth is that if as a nation we are desirous of developing policies that will engineer prosperity in the oil and gas sectors while saving the people of the region, then, we must be ready to locate the strategic triangles that hold the key to success.	Regardless of wetin oda pipo tok, di truth be say if all of us get am for mind to develop policy wey go bring prosperity for oil and gas sector, while we go still save di pipo for di region, we ready to find di strategic triangles wey hold di key to success for hand.
Separate from the fact that success requires a careful analysis of the various kinds of knowledge needed to make innovation possible, the need for the nation to straddle the middle ground has become necessary since both the ministry and sector have for a very long time manifested signs of an institution with neither primed nor positioned potentials.	Apart from di fact say success need make dem analyse am wit care, of di different kind of knowledge wey dem need to make innovation possible, e don necessary for di nation make dem hold di middle ground since both di ministry and sector don dey manifest signs for long time now say dem go be institution wey no get potential wey strong.
And as we know, any organisation, be it private or public that fails to search for its potentials leaves its survival to chance.	And as we know, any organization, whether private or public wey no gree search for hin potential, hin survival na by chance.
At this instant, looking at both the operational templates of the ministry and how the up, mid and the downstream players of the petroleum industry have become reputed for non-compliance to set rules,  it will not be a wrong assertion to conclude that the critical factors fueling crude oil spillage/gas flaring can be divided into the following; the existence of  multiple but obsolete regulatory framework, which characterises the oil and gas exploration and production in Nigeria; federal governments failure to get the nations refineries back to full refining capacity; the petroleum ministrys inability to get committed  to making International Oil Companies(IOCs) adhere strictly to the international best practices as it relates to their operational environment; And finally, non-existence of clear responsibility/work details and action plans for agencies and parastatals functioning under the ministry.	For dis level, if we luk di operational template of di ministry, and how dey don know say di up, mid and down stream players of di petroleum industry say dem no dey follow rules, e no go dey wrong make pesin conclude say dem fit divide di serious reasons wey dey kos Crude oil spillage/gas flarin to; regulatory framework wey plenti wey no dey work, oil and gas exploration and production for Nigeria dey; federal goment failure to make di kontri refineries dey work to dia full capacity back ; petroleum ministry inability to make International Oil Companies dey follow di international best practices as e relate to di environment wey dem dey work; Di last one, clear responsibility/work details wey no dey and action plans for agencies and parastatals wey dey function under di ministry.
The above failures have as a direct consequence; cast a long dark shadow on the ministry, the sector and the region.	Di failures dem wey dey up get direct consequence, na bad influence for di sector, di ministry and di region.
To explain these points beginning with the first challenge, it is worth commenting that the business of crude oil exploration and issues of oil production in the country is regulated by multiple but very weak laws and Acts of which most of these laws not only complicate enforcement but are curiously too old-fashioned for the changing demands of time thereby, creating loopholes for operators, especially the International Oil Companies (IOC) to exploit both the government and host communities.	To take explain dis points, make we use di first challenge start, e dey important to dey tok about di law dem wey regulate crude oil exploration and oil production issue wey plenti law dey regulate but too dey weak and di Acts wey dey law wey no dey just complicate how e dey work, but e don too old as time don dey change, e dey create corner corner way for pipo wey dey operate for der especially the International Oil Companies (IOC)  make dem fit use exploit both di goment and host communities.
Some of these laws/Acts in question that have been in operation since the 1960s but currently not achieving their purpose includes but not limited to; the Petroleum Act of 1969, The Harmful Waste(Special Criminal Positions etc), Act 1988, Mineral Oil Safety Regulation 1963, Petroleum(Drilling and Production) Regulation 1969	some of dis laws/acts wey we dey tok about don dey since 1960 but dey no dey achieve dia purpose wey Di Petroleum Act of 1969, Di Harmful Waste(Special Criminal Positions etc), Act 1988, Mineral Oil Safety Regulation 1963, Petroleum(Drillin and Production) Regulation 1969 dey but no be oly dis one dem.
(Subsidiary Legislation to the Petroleum Act) and the off-shore Oil Revenue (Registration of Grants)Act 1971 among others.	(Subsidiary Legislation to Petroleum Act) and di off-shore Oil Revenue (Registration of Grants) Acts 1971 among odas.
Without minding their number, concepts, provisions and definitions, these laws have become obsolete, old-schooled and out-fashioned to the extent that they now provide leeway for the operators in the sector to exploit both the government and host communities.	As dey no mind di number, concept, provision and definition dem, dis law dem no dey useful again, dey don old to di extent say dem dey give pipo wey dey work for di sector corner corner to dey chop both di goment and host community dem.

The threat to murder in cold-blood by one Emma Powerful, media and publicity secretary of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) of any Igbo who neglects his warning is certainly going too far and should not be ignored, except we have finally descended into anarchy, where the powerful  as the little fascist, Mr. Emma Powerful as he called himself  can drag people out for merely disagreeing with him or his organization and have them dispatched to their ancestor as he boasted.	Emma Powerful wey be media and publicity secretary for IPOB threat to dey kil any Igbo pesin wey no follow hin warning don dey too serious, and dey no suppose ignore am except say we no get goment, wer small small fascist like Mr Emma Powerful as he call himsef go dey tok say hin go dey drag pipo kom out, dey send dem go meet Baba God as he tok bikos dey no follow am or hin organization.
He did not seem to boast empty; as the mayhem that is enveloping the South East region of Nigeria is obviously orchestrated.	Di mouth wey hin dey run no be play; as e be say di kasala for Nigeria South-east show say na plan dey plan am.
Bereft of the understandingg of the simple Igbo leadership etiquette, where a leader is Onye-oje ozi,or servant of his people who builds consensus through extensive consultation, the Emma Powerful who prefer a thuggish title of Onye-ike,whose basic instrument is coercion, intimidation and now threat to murder the same Ndigbo, who he claim to champion their cause.	As he no understand how simple Igbo leadership dey be, wey be say dia leader na Onye-oje ozi or servant of hin pipo, wey make di pipo agree wit am afta he don consult plenti pipo, Emma Powerful wey prefer one thug title, Onye-ike, wey be say na to dey force dem, make dem fear am and now he dey threaten to kil di same Ndigbo wey he say he dey fight for.
For a man so intolerant and wired to effortlessly shed blood to advance his cause, the question is who would really want to live in a Cave Republic run by bloody thugs.	For man wey be say he no dey tolarate, wey be say to kil pipo take push hin cause no be kasala, di question be say who go wan stay tru tru for Cave Republic wey be say na thug dey run am
The historical Biafra was not a choice made by Ndigbo; it was rather the only available option forced on Ndigbo at the time at a particular time in history, which they braved out with enormous heroism and sacrifice to defend and uphold.	Di Biafra wey pipo know for history no be Ndigbo choice; Na di only choice wey dem force Ndigbo do be dat for dat time, wey dem face bravely wit plenti courage and sacrifice so dem go fit defend and uphold
Biafra was not so much rebellion as it was a resistance to affirm the right of a people   not only to exist but to live in dignity.	Biafra no too oppose authority reach how dey try make di pipo right dey valid, no be say make dem just exist, but na to live wit dignity.
The historical Biafra was a line of safety drawn so that all of the Igbo people  then, brutally persecuted  who crossed into, can live in relative safety.	Di Biafra wey dey history na like safety precaution for all Igbo pipo wey suppose don too suffer dat time fit kom, place wey dey fit stay safely.
The declaration and the struggle of the historical Biafra was not a show piece or a profit-making enterprise for which the current purveyors are curiously engaged in.	Di declaration and di struggle of di old Biafra no be show or avenue to make moni wey di pipo wey dey lead am dey do pass now.
Prior to the declaration of Biafra in 1967, the Eastern consultative assembly, a formidable representative and consultative body of all shades of opinions in the eastern region, given the circumstances of the time unanimously agreed and gave their authority to the declaration.	Before dem declare Biafra for 1967, Eastern Consultative assembly, one group wey dey represent, still dey advice for all di opinion wey pipo get for east, bikos of wetin dey apun gree say make dem make di declaration wit dia authority.
And that was why the war to defend the young republic was a widely shared enterprise of Ndigbo and even other non-Igbo ethnic nationalities in the region, who made unforgettable sacrifices.	Na di reason wey make di whole Ndigbo and oda tribe wey no be Igbo, wey sacrifice, wey dem no fit forget gree protect di republic wey still small
Even as the war ended, with the collapse of Biafra, and national reconciliation, Ndigbo returned to project Nigeria without malice and with considerable determination and courage, to enable it work.

The context of contemporary Nigerias crises and deepening fissures is on account of a neo-capitalist state hobbled by the backwardness and fetter of the productive forces, shackled and unable to reproduce the material basis for its existence.	Di context of new Nigeria kasala and disagreement for dia point of view wey dey deep na bikos of one neo-capitalist state wey dey go backward, and di chain of di productive forces, wey dem chain, wey no fit produce di material of hin existence again.
As the contemporary Nigerias state grows hollow and enters a melting point of atrophy and lethargy, the basic units consisting of ethnic nationalities and other civic, cultural and religious entities struggle for a space of self-preservation, expression and recreation.	As di new Nigeria kasala dey grow, wey e no dey progress and e slow, di simple tins like tribe, culture and religion dey struggle to preserve, express and recreate diasef.
In the overall, it is easier to brandish a secessionist flag, without an iota of understandingg of the critical socio-economic infrastructure on which a viable state can be constructed.	ova-all, e dey easy to carry retirement flag, wen dey no understand how socio-economic infrastructure dey important if dey wan build kontri wey go survive.
Africas newest state, South Sudan is still tragically in the intensive care unit, leaving the larger number of her population in worse condition than the earlier condition before a brand new state was created.

There is nothing to indicate that the current loud canvasser of Biafra has any insight into what a state establishment and construction is all about.	Notin show say Biafra current leader wey like to dey make noise know anythin about how dem dey build or create kontri
Even as the independent state, the yearn for are not in insight, the authoritarian and fascist streak of its purveyors like the threat of the Emma powerful that whoever disagrees with him would be dispatched to meet his ancestors are already evident.	Even if dem dey independent, to built state no dey di real deal, to dey command pipo witout respect , make di fascist leaders like Emma Powerful wey dey threaten to kil pipo don show already.
Ndigbo is quite sophisticated to be led by thugs and touts, who lack the simple understandingg that Igbo political culture and framework is basically consultative.	Ndigbo too posh to get leaders wey be thug and tout, wey no understand say Igbo political culture and framework na to dey consult elders.
The little dictator Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, who does not know any village in Igboland, besides his own, claims the leadership of Igbo nation as entitlement, a people, whose lives he hardly understood, except for the inflow of donations from its diaspora.	Mr Nnamdi Kanu wey been dey command dem, no know any village for Igboland apart from hin own, dey claim to be dia leader like say na hin own, pipo wey be say he no know how dem dey live except for di moni wey hin dey send give dem from abroad.
The media and publicity secretary, Mr. Emma, the Powerful through arrogance and petty fascist impunity has done more damage to the Igbo basic framework of consultation and consensus.	Mr Emma "di Powerful" wey be dia media and publicity secretary don use hin arrogance and petty fascist inpunity spoil Igbo basic framework wey be say na to dey consult pipo and to dey agree for somethin generally before dey do am.
Only a thuggish organization issues threats of murder and destruction to those who disagree with it.	Na only organisation wey thug full dey threaten to destroy pipo wey no gree wit am.
But this latest threat issued by Mr. Emma, de powerful to dispatch to ancestors; Ndigbo who refused to fall in line with him, is going too far.	But dis new threat wey Mr Emma "de Powerful" issue say he go send pipo go meet dia forefathers sake of say dem no follow am, don too much.
For that reason alone, him and his cronies need to be curbed to avoid all sorts of shenanigans.	Sake of dat one reason, dey suppose find way restrict hin and hin pipo to avoid kasala

Pastor Adefarasin, if Nigeria is a scam; then were all scammers	Pastor Adefarasin; if Nigeria na scam; den all of us na scammers
It is the bounden duty of every citizen to hold the government to account.	Na di compulsory duty of everi citizen to hold di government to account.
In fact, citizenship is a call to duty  for the state.	In fact, citizenship na call to duty for di state.
And there is no compelling duty which supersedes citizens subjecting their employees  the government  to scrutiny and constant vigilance.	And no compulsory duty wey pass make citizens dey scrutinize and monitor dia employees “ di government“ frequently.
Criticising the government is within the rights of every citizen, and active citizenship demands taking the government through its paces.	Criticising di government na part of di rights of everi citizen, and active citizenship get to do wit takin di governmentthroughe pace.
No government is without criticism, and none is too special for criticism.	No government wey dem no dey criticise, and no government too special for pipo to criticise.
However, we must distinguish between any government and Nigeria as a country.	But, we need differentiate between any government and Nigeria as a kontri.
Governments will come and go, but Nigeria remains.	Government go kom and go, but Nigeria go remain.
We must understand Nigeria is its people.	We need understand say Nigeria na di pipo wey dey inside.
So, when we cast pejoratives at the country we are only slinging shots at ourselves.	So, wen we belittle di kontri, we just dey shoot awasef for leg.
If we say, Nigeria is a scam, inadvertently we are implying, Nigerians are scammers.	If we tok say Nigeria na scam, indirectly wetin we mean be say, Nigerians be scammers.
Nigeria did not become a scam, as some of those reviling the nation say, by accident; it became whatever it is by the machination of all of us.	Nigeria no be scam, like som of dose wey dey abuse di nation dey always tok, unknowingly; Na we turn Nigeria to anytin wey e be.
Nigeria is not a mere geographical expression.	Nigeria no be just a place somwia.
Nigeria is its people.	Nigeria na di pipo.
The good, the bad and the ugly  we made it so.	Di gud, di bad and di ugly “ na we make am be laidat.
Whatever is ailing the country we are a vector of the causative factors.	Anytin wey dey affect di kontri, na we be di agent wey cause am.
If Nigeria is a scam  as alleged by Pastor Paul Adefarasin  then we are all scammers.	If Nigeria na scam as Pastor Paul Adefarasin tok, den we all be scammers.
Though I concede that Adefarasins outburst might have come from a place of patriotism, his cataloguing of Nigeria as a scam and fraud falls short of tact and critical reasoning.	Even say I agree, say Adefarasin anger na becos of di love wey e get for di kontri, im comment say Nigeria na scam and fraud no dey reasonable. 
If Nigeria is a fraud; then we are all fraudsters  leaders and followers alike.	If Nigeria na fraud; den all of us be fraudster, leaders and followers join.
We all have contributed in no small measure to the discomfiture of the entity.	All of us don contribute to di dissapointment of di entity.
We live in a country where pastors run their ministries like conglomerates.	We dey live for a kontri wia pastors dey run dia ministry like business.
They run them like business enterprises  but evading tax in the process.	Dem dey run am like business enterprise but dem no dey pay tax for dere.
CAMA; a law to regulate the business undertakings of the religious industry and to bring some transparency and accountability into the spiritual business was introduced by the government.	CAMA; Government introduce a law wey go regulate di business undertaking of di religious industry and wey go bring som transparency and accountability inside di spiritual business.
However, the staunchest antagonists of this law have been pastors.	But na pastors dey against dis law pass.
Yet, these same people who do not want to live by the law are the loudest voices when passing capital sentences on Nigeria.	Still, na dis same pipo wey no wan follow di law be di loudest voice wen dem dey pass capital sentence on Nigeria.
Interestingly, these pastors run their churches in conformity with the law in other countries.	Funny tin be say, dis pastors dey follow di law of oda kontri dey run dia church for dose kontri.
They submit their finances for regular checks by the authorities in the UK, the US and other places.	Dem dey submit dia finance for regular check by di authorities for UK, US and oda places.
But in Nigeria they live in triumph of the law.	But for Nigeria dem dey live above di law.
Pastor Chris Oyakhilome has been spreading injurious falsehood regarding COVID vaccine.	Pastor Chris Oyakhilome don dey spread harmful lies about COVID vaccine.
He claims it is the concoction of the anti-Christ.	E claim say na di concoction of di anti-Christ.
He was fined 125,000 pounds for making potentially harmful and unsubstantiated claims about the vaccine by the UK.	Dem fine am 125,000 pounds for Uk, sake of say e dey tok harmful and unsubstantiated tins about di vaccine.
But in Nigeria where he continues to traffic in COVID conspiracies, he has not been made to account for his transgressions because he is a man of god.	But for Nigeria wia e dey kontinue to bring different COVID conspiracy, dem neva call am to kom explain im offence, sake of say na man of god e be. 
Perhaps, this is why Nigeria is a scam.	Maybe na why Nigeria be scam.
If Nigeria is a scam, then it is because of pastors who sit on high and trample on the laws governing the land.	If Nigeria na scam, den na becos of pastors wey dey siddun for top, kom dey step on di law wey dey govern di land.
If Nigeria is a fraud, then it is because of pastors who go into concordats with politicians every election season; campaigning for them on the pulpit and commanding the bloodhounds of hell against those who do not accept their anointed candidates.	If Nigeria na fraud, den na becos of pastors wey dey sign agreement wit politicians everi election period; dey campaign for dem on di altar, dey command di demons of hell untop dose wey no gree accept dia anointed candidate.
The clergy is as tainted as the political class.	Clergymen dey as corrupt as di politikal class.
Also, a civil servant, who earns N150,000 monthly but has kids in UK schools and with real estate dotting major cities in the country, will revile Nigeria submerging his own hypocrisy in lamentations and jibes at the state.	Also, civil servant, wey dey collect N150,000 per month, but get pikin for UK school, and property for all ova di major cities of di kontri, go abuse Nigeria and carry all im hypocrisy put for lamentation and insult to di state.
He ignores conveniently his complicity in the corruption ravaging the country.	E go calm down ignore e own contribution for di corruption wey dey destroy di kontri.
In addition, some citizens spurn laws, rules and regulations.	Also, som citizens dey reject laws, rules and regulations.
Where there are traffic lights, they ignore them; where there are procedures, they bypass them, and where there are standards put in place for effective service delivery and operations, they abandon them.	Wia traffic light dey, dem go ignore am; wia protocol dey, dem go bypass am, and for places wia dem don get standard for gud service delivery and operations, dem go abandon am.
Yet, they all blame â€˜Nigeria for the jeopardous status quo as if the country exists without its people.	Still, all of dem go blame Nigeria for di bad status quo as if say di kontri dey exist witout di pipo.
The problem with Nigeria is a people problem.	Di problem wey Nigeria get na pipo problem.
But the tragedy is that no one wants to accept liability for the appalling state of things.	But di bad tin be say nobodi wan take responsibility for di terrible way wey tins be.
We cast the blame at the feet of abstract Nigeria.	We dey blame di Nigeria wey no exist.
We are all complicit in the degenerative emasculation of Nigeria.	Na all of us get hand for inside di bad situation of Nigeria.
Instead of abiding in wilful fatalism about Nigeria, we should project goodness and positivity into the system while working at making our country what we want it to be.	Instead make we dey follow di tin wey we don conclude about Nigeria, make we forsee goodness and positivity into di system, and make we dey work to make awa kontri di tin wey we want make e be.
Nigeria is what we make of it.	Nigeria go be wetin we want make e be.
The political class is flawed.	Di politicians get comma.
But that is the reason a new generation of leaders must emerge and take the reins.	But dat na di reason why new generation of leaders must come up and take kontrol.
None but ourselves can free our minds.	Nobodi fit free awa mind except us.
Citizenship is a call to duty.	Citizenship na call to duty.
NIGERIA IS NOT A SCAM.	NIGERIA NO BE SCAM.
Why secession is not the Silver Bullet to Nigerias challenges	Why separation no be di Silver Bullet to Nigeria challenges
The principle of self-determination as enshrined in the UN charter and which our secessionists latch on to was enacted at a time many peoples of the world were under colonial yoke or other forms of domination by outside powers.	Di principle of self-determination as e dey for di UN charter wey awa pipo wey wan separate hold-on to, take effect for a time wey many pipo for di world dey under colonial yoke or oda form of kontrol by outside power.
The principle was to give fillip to independence and liberation movements in order for them to gain their freedom and determine their path of future development.	Di principle na to give chance to independence and liberation movements so dem go fit gain dia freedom and determine dia path of future development.
In our world today, this principle applies only to a handful of peoples as an overwhelming majority of the world are now free from colonial subjugation and self-governing.	For di world wey we dey today, dis principle only apply to few pipo, becos majority of di world don dey free from colonial kontrol and sef-governing.
Thus the principle of self-determination, which was enacted under the UN charter, will have to be amended to accommodate the demands of our secessionists because going by its intendment and wordings they hardly qualify.	So dem go need adjust di principle of sef-determination, wey dem establish under di UN charter, so e go fit accommodate di demand of awa pipo wey wan separate, becos if we follow wetin dey dere, dem no qualify.
First of all, they have to prove constructively and convincingly that the areas they purport to represent are under some form of subjugation and that they lack the basic freedoms that all peoples should enjoy as required under the UN charter.	First of all, dem go need to prove carefully and convincingly say di area wey dem claim to represent dey under som form of kontrol, and say dem dey lack di basic freedom wey everibodi suppose enjoy as e dey di UN charter.
And in the unlikely case of proving that, they will also have to convince the UN of the steps they have taken from the national (National Assembly), sub-regional (ECOWAS) and continental level (AU) to press their case.	And for wia dem wan prove dat one, dem go need convince di UN on di steps wey dem don take, from di national (National Assembly), sub-regional (ECOWAS) and continental level (AU) to present dia case.
And the UN will not just take their word for it.	And di UN no go just take dia word laidat.
There will be fact finding committees to determine whether indeed Nigeria as a country practises the basic requirements of democracy or not.	Dem go get committee wey go confam di fact to know weda true-true, Nigeria as a kontri dey practise di basic requirement of demokracy or not.
The case is even made trickier by the fact that those areas are neither disputed territories nor under any trusteeship requiring a UN referendum to either confer direct independence to them or ask them which of the competing powers they wished to join.	Dem don even complicate di case wit di fact say dose areas no be area wey dem dey fight untop, and no be area wey dey under any trusteeship wey go need UN referendum to give dem direct independence or ask dem who dem wan join inside di pipo wey dey fight untop di place. 
If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements, the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities.	If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements, the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities.
It does not lend its very elaborate and transparent processes to be abused by movements that hardly know what they are about.	E no dey give chance make som movement wey no know wetin dem dey about abuse im wide and transparent process. 
The case of marginalisation, which is also cited as one of the reasons for secession, is too trivial to even waste our time on.	Di case of marginalisation, wey dem mention as part of di reason for separation, dey too simple to waste awa time untop.
Every democratic system provides for winners and losers in elections.	Na everi democratik system dey get winner and loser for election.
And as imperfect as our political system is, the constitution compels mandatory representation in government and its institutions for as many ethnic nationalities and geo-political zones as possible.	And as awa politikal system no perfect reach, di konstitution make am compulsory say as many ethnic group and geo-political zones as possible must get representative for government and im institutions.
The secessionist would have a tough time convincing the outside world that their case for marginalisation is more compelling than those of the over 300 other ethnic nationalities inhabiting Nigeria.	E go tough for di pipo wey wan separate to convince di outside world say dia case of marginalisation dey more compelling pass dat of more dan 300 oda ethnic group wey dey Nigeria.
In other words, why would the international community, to which the secessionists address their grievances and from which they seek support for their cause, single out just two out of the hundreds of such cases ringing in the Nigerian media for action?	Wetin dis one mean be say, why di international community, wey di pipo wey wan separate dey report and seek support from go single out jus two out of like hundred of dat kind case wey dey ring for di Nigerian media say na im dem go work on ?
What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession?	What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession?
On all the three premises that our secessionists base their agitations, none is convincing or compelling enough to justify their actions.	Out of all di three tins wey make awa secessionists dey agitate, no one dey convincing or compelling enough to justify dia action.
On the amalgamation argument, Nigeria is not a unique case in Africa or indeed the world.	On di amalgamation argument, Nigeria own no be special case for Afrika or for di world.
If Nigeria has to be broken up because it was wrongly amalgamated by Britain, then this applies to virtually all but a few countries in Africa.	If Nigeria go need break up unto say Britain no join am well, den dis go be di case of almost all di kontris for Afrika.
In essence if this principle were to be applied it will set the course for the commencement of a new scramble for Africa by the old and emerging powers of the world in which Africans as before will be the victims.	In short, if dem use dis principle, e go start di course to begin a new scramble for Africa by di old and upcoming world powers, and like befor, na Afrikans go be di victim.
Let us not deceive ourselves for the disintegration of Nigeria if it happens (God forbid) will result in the emergence of entities	Make we no deceive awasef, becos if di break-up of Nigeria happun (God forbid), e go lead to di birth of kontris
too weak such that they will find themselves at the mercy of foreign powers.	wey go dey weak sotey, dem go dey beg from di foreign powers.
Some arguments have been made of a break up of Nigeria along the lines of Eastern European states and in the Balkans.	We don get som argument wey dey compare di break up of Nigeria wit dat of Eastern European states and di Balkans.
In this regard, it will serve us well to discern that what works for Europe may not necessarily work for Africa.	Untop dis one, e go beta make we undastand well say di tin wey work for Europe fit no work for Africa.
In the case of the aforementioned countries, it was part of great geo-strategic games of the major world powers who had direct cultural, economic and political links and interests in the emerging scenarios.	In di case of di kontris wey we mention, na part of di great geo-strategic games of di major world powers wey get direct cultural, economik and politikal link and interest for di emerging scenario.
And these countries had defined borders before they agreed to come together for mutual defence in the uncertain situation of the Second World War.	And dis kontris don get clear boundary befor dem agree to kom togeda for mutual defence durin di uncertain situation of di Second World War.
Once the Soviet order, which held them together, began to unravel the need arose for the peripheral countries to revert to the status quo ante.	Immediately di Soviet order, wey join dem togeda begin dey scatter, all dis kontris need go back to di status quo ante.
And, more importantly, these developments had the backing and guarantees of the principal powers in Europe and the world in the quest for a balance of power.	And, more importantly, dis developments get di backing and guarantee of di important powers for Europe and di world.
Do Nigerian secessionists have such reckoning and profile in the calculations of the principal powers of the world to warrant their time?	Se Nigerian secessionists get dat kind recognition and profile in di face of di principal powers of di world wey go make dem answer dem?
The answer obviously is zilch.	Surely, di answer na zero.
This is, however, not dismissing that the agitations for secession in the country do not have some justifiable basis.	Dis no kom mean say di agitation of pipo to separate for di kontri no get som gud reason.
Anybody living in this country with the rising case of insecurity, poverty, corruption, nepotism, economic uncertainties amidst the unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of the government to these challenges will conclude that indeed we have a state that is failing in its basic constitutional duties and responsibilities.	Anybodi wey dey live for dis kontri wit dis rising case of insecurity, poverty, corruption, nepotism, economic uncertainty and di unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of di government to dis challenges go conclude say truly, we dey for a kontri wey dey fail for im basic konstitutional duties and responsibilities.
And in a fragile country like ours with gaping fault lines, tendencies or preferences for dissolution of the union are bound to emerge and grow exponentially along with the clear dysfunctionality of the government of the day.	And for a fragile kontri like awa own, wey get plenti fault, e dey normal for tendency or preference for separation to arise and grow fast wit di clear dysfunctionality of di government wey dey.
And these feelings are all round.	And na everybodi get dis dis feeling.
But daunting as the outlook is and tempting as the prospect appears, secession cannot be the solution to our existential challenges as a nation.	But as discouragin as di outlook be, and as temptin as di outcome dey appear, separation no fit be di solution to awa current challenge as a nation.
Indeed it is a prospect fraught with lurking uncertain dangers not least for its proponents but for the country as a whole.	Indeed na prospect wey get som unknown dangers, danger wey no be for di secessionists alone but for di kontri as a whole.
Nigeria is not imperfect.	Nigeria no dey perfect.
Even some of the advanced countries have shown that despite years of existence and well defined systems, they are not immune from crises arising from internal contradictions.	Even som of di advance kontris don show say despite dia years of existence and dia gud systems, dem no dey free from crises wey dey kom from internal conflict.
We should not delude ourselves that in trying to break up our country, some countries will benevolently assist us.	Make we no dey deceive awasef say as we dey try break up awa kontri, som kontris go graciously assist us.
What they will do is provide us with the means to destroy and weaken ourselves in the process and then proceed to profit from that at our own expense.	Wetin dem go do na to give us di means to destroy and weaken awasef, so dem go fit benefit while we go suffer am. 
That is the reality of the international system.	Na di truth about di international system be dat.
As the distinguished German beamter at the beginning of my article said and advised; we are at once our own problems and our own solutions.	As di popular German beamter tok for di beginnin of my paper; Na we be awa own problem and solution join togeda.
We must put our thoughts, talents and efforts collectively to developing Nigeria rather than breaking it up.	We need put awa mind, talent and effort togeda to develop Nigeria instead say we wan breaking am.

What Kano needs in 2023	Wetin Kano need for 2023
Kano needs to chart a new path to development in 2023.	Kano need create new path to development for 2023.
This is because the state is sliding into the pit of poverty.	Dis na becos di state don dey enta di pit of poverty.
Our rich pre-colonial history indicates that Kano was the richest of all Hausa states because of state involvement in the economy.	Awa rich pre-colonial history show say na Kano rich pass for all di Hausa states, becos di state dey involve for di economy.
Although, the colonialists destroyed the economic foundation of Kano and other colonised societies the policies of those who led the Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contributed to maintaining Kano as the leading economic centre of Northern Nigeria.	Even say di colonialists destroy di economic foundation of Kano and oda society wey dem colonise, di policy of di pipo wey lead di Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contribute to make Kano remain as di leadin economic centre of Northern Nigeria.
For example, they established the first modern water treatment plant in the region in 1931, the first independent power plant in Northern Nigeria of 15mw and for over 80 years, no similar one has been established in Northern Nigeria.	For example, dem establish di first modern water treatment plant wey dey di region for 1931, di first independent power plant for Northern Nigeria, wey get 15MW, and for more dan 80 years, dem neva establish any one wey resemble am for Northern Nigeria.
They established the first industrial estate in the Northern Region, they inherited one primary school in 1926 and by 1963 every village had a primary school (hundreds), they established secondary schools, they inherited no hospital (but one dispensary) and by 1963 there were two general hospitals and hundreds of dispensaries in every village headed by Dagachi had one.	Dem establish di first industrial estate wey dey di Northern Region, dem inherit only one primary school for 1926, and for 1963 everi village don get primary school (more dan hundred), dem establish secondary schools, dem no meet any hospital (except one dispensary) and for 1963 dem don build two general hospital and more dan hundred dispensaries for everi village.
They laid the foundation of modern Kano.	Na dem lay di foundation of modern Kano.
Politically, they made the NPC to become the ruling party of Nigeria.	Politikally, na dem make di NPC becom di rulin party for Nigeria.
From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999, Kano still maintained its position as second to Lagos.	From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999, Kano still maintain im position as di second to Lagos.
Kano does not have control over macro-economic policies but its leaders can provide the enabling environment for economic growth.	Kano no get kontrol ova macro-economic policy but e leaders fit provide di right environment for economic growth.
For example, the Dawanau Market, which is the largest grains market in West Africa bringing people from all parts of the continent from as far as Gabon and Congo.	For example, di Dawanau Market, wey still be di biggest grain market for West Africa, e dey bring pipo from all part of di kontinent, even from far place like Gabon and Congo.
This was all as a result of the foresight of Alhaji Bashari Garko (may Allah bless his soul), who established the market.	All dis na result of di foresight wey Alhaji Bashari Garko (may Allah bless im soul), wey establish di market get.
The three administrations that governed Kano from 1999 to date, could all claim that each one of them was the best thing that has happened to Kano but why has Kano degenerated to number nine in Nigeria?	Di three administration wey don rule Kano from 1999 till today, fit claim say all of dem be di best tin wey don happun to Kano, but why Kano don reduce to numba nine for Nigeria?
There is no single project that has brought any significant economic change in Kano despite several efforts by concerned individuals.	One single project no dey wey don bring correct economic change for Kano, even afta plenti effort of consign pipo.
If there is elite focus and determination, with state leadership as it was in the pre-colonial period, Kano would not have gone down to number nine in Nigeria with a GDP of $13.30b after Lagos ($46.03b), Rivers ($32.14b), Delta ($25.48b), Oyo ($21.64b), Imo ($20.64), Edo ($17.50b), Akwa Ibom ($15.26) and Ogun ($13.82).	If di elite dey focus and determine, wit state leadership as e dey for di pre-colonial period, Kano no go go down to numba nine for Nigeria wit GDP of $13.30b afta Lagos ($46.03b), Rivers ($32.14b), Delta ($25.48b), Oyo ($21.64b), Imo ($20.64), Edo ($17.50b), Akwa Ibom ($15.26) and Ogun ($13.82).
The catastrophe in the next 10 years if not averted now, will be beyond our imagination.	If we no prevent am now, we no go fit imagine di disaster wey go kom in di next 10 years.
This is because of many reasons, one of which is we have over four million pupils in public basic schools (primary and JSS) and by 2033 they would have completed secondary education.	Dis na becos of many reasons. One of dem be say we get more dan four million pupils for public basic schools (primary and JSS) and by 2033 dem go don finish secondary education.
Assuming only 10 percent of them (400,000) will proceed to higher-level can the government fund their education?	Assume say na onli 10 percent of dem (400,000) go go higher-level, di government go fit sponsor dia education?
After completing higher education, can the economy absorb them with gainful employment?	Afta dem complete higher education, di economy go fit give dem beta employment?
At the current state of development, it cannot.	As e be so, e no fit.
This is because, there are over 250 medical doctors and over 1000 nurses sponsored by the state government, who could not be absorbed despite the need.	Dis na becos, more dan 250 medical doctors and more dan 1000 nurses wey di state government dey sponsor, na im dem no fit employ.
We keep deceiving ourselves with so-called skills acquisition programmes that train artisans who will not get any job after acquiring the skills because the local economy cannot absorb them.	We go dey deceive awasef wit di skills acquisition programme wey dey train artisans wey no go get any job afta dem learn di skills, sake of say di local economy no fit employ dem.
Every day we hear billions allocated by the federal government for one economic programme or the other and yet our ideas are never beyond training plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc.	Everi day we dey hear billions wey federal government allocate for one economic programme or di oda, and still, we no dey reason pass to train plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc.
Our ideas, so far, are not about harnessing resources for the employment of a larger population as Gajimasu (1095-1135) did when he started the city walls.	Since, awa idea no dey about how we go use resources employ di large population as Gajimasu (1095-1135) do wen e begin di city walls.
We have to think out of the box.	We need tink outside di box.
Kano does not need a superhuman being with the best qualifications and experience or a saint as the next governor.	Kano no need genius wey get di best qualification and experience, or saint as di next governor.
This is because the governors in the last 20 years possessed some of the best qualities and might have even done their best but as we can all see, the outcome has not been the best for the state.	Dis na becos di governors wey dey for di last 20 years get som of di best quality, and dem fit even don do dia best, but as all of us dey see, di result no be di best for di state.
Therefore, we must think out of the box.	So, we need reason outside di box.
The two parties APC and PDP cannot provide the desired leadership because they are controlled by godfathers, not ideologically driven, but mainly concerned with sharing of state resources.	Di two parties, APC and PDP no fit provide di kind leadership wey we want, sake of say na godfathers dey kontrol dem, and dem no get idea on wetin to do, but dia main focus na how to share di state resources.
The best they can offer is to negotiate for a governor who will serve the interest of a godfather or a clique.	Di best tin wey dem fit do na to negotiate for governor wey go serve di interest of a godfather or cabal.
Therefore, the two parties are not the best options.	So, di two parties no be di best option.
A very good person could emerge using his resources or with the help of other well-meaning patriotic people.	Beta pesin fit kom outside on e own, or wit di help of oda beta patriotic pipo.
He could win through any efforts including negotiating with even any of the two parties or another party.	E fit use any way win, even if e negotiate wit any of di two parties or anoda party sef.
This is a possibility.	E dey possible
It has happened before.	E  don happun befor.
An example, in the neighbouring Kaduna State, is Nasir Elrufai.	One example wey dey near us na Nasir Elrufai for Kaduna State.
He is one of the best in his generation but security in the state is beyond him because he depends on his personal intelligence and capacity.	Im be one of di best for im generation, but di security situation for di state don pass im power, sake of say e dey depend on im personal intelligence and capacity.
A better person than him in Kano will not make it the desired place unless certain fundamentals are changed.	Pesin wey beta pass am for Kano no go make di place beta unless dem change som important tins. 
I do not claim to have all the answers or even to be exclusively original in the ideas below.	I no claim say I get all di answer or even say na me get all di idea wey dey down.
Some of them are even modifications of Aminu Kanos ideas.	Som of dem na part of Aminu Kano idea.
There are many better ideas in the minds of more intelligent people.	Plenti beta idea dey for di mind of more intelligent pipo. 
The ideas I am suggesting are based on my little experience as a labourer of politicians and some training outside this country.	Di idea wey I dey suggest na base on my small experience as labourer of politicians and som trainin wey I get outside dis kontri.
Kano is on the crossroad, therefore, these ideas could be useful.	Right now, Kano dey crossroad, and dis ideas fit dey useful.
Some people need to come together and organise a political movement not owned by any individual but people willing to sacrifice.	Som pipo need kom togeda to organise one political movement wey no dey in kontrol of anybodi but pipo wey wan sacrifice.
It should kindly consider the suggestions below:	Make dem look di suggestion below:
There is a need to initiate political organisation at the lowest level and making the members own it.	Need dey for us to start political organisation at di lowest level and make sure say na di members dey in kontrol.
No material reward but sacrifice.	Material reward no go dey, but sacrifice.
This is possible with mobilisation and the right messages.	Dis dey possible wit mobilisation and di right message.
Before the election, the movement or party must take a comprehensive inventory of the state and design a comprehensive action plan with specific measurable targets.	Befor di election, di movement or party need take detail inventory of di state and design comprehensive action plan wit specific targets wey dey measurable .
There should be operational guidelines for all appointees including the governor, which must be popularised for every citizen to know and challenge if breeched.	Operational guidelines go dey for all appointees plus di governor, and dem go need announce am so every citizen go fit know and challenge, if dem no follow am.
No one who seeks any position should be given such a position in the movement or party from the lowest level to the highest.	Anybodi wey dey find position inside di movement or party, go begin from di lowest level to di highest.
Some will argue this kills ambition.	Som pipo go argue say dis strategy go kill ambition.
What is needed now is not ambition but a sustainable system owned by the people.	Wetin we need now no be ambition but sustainable system wey dey in kontrol of di pipo.
Similarly, no one should be given any position until he fulfils certain basic conditions of competence and honesty as well as bringing references and guarantors.	Also, make dem no give anybodi any position unless e don fulfil som basic condition of competence and honesty, and e go bring reference and guarantor.
All public officials must publicly declare their assets and those of their family members on the assumption of office, which must be verified by forensic experts.	All public officers must declare dia asset publicly, and dia family members own join, immediately dem reach office. And forensic experts go need verify everytin .
Their salaries, expenses (including travels, entertainment etc) must be made public periodically.	From time to time, di public need dey know dia salary and expenses (plus travel, entertainment etc).
No one who becomes a governor or attains any position should ever be allowed to act unilaterally.	Anybodi wey becom governor or reach any position no go ever do tins on e own. 
The governor must never be allowed	Di governor no go ever
To make appointments unilaterally.	Make appointment alone.
There must be criteria, expectations or set targets for such appointments for periodic assessments and evaluations; 	Criteria, go dey, dem go need set expectation or target for dose kind appointment, and dem go need dey assess and evaluate am from time to time. 
All contracts must be transparently awarded after evaluation by experts from within and outside the bureaucracy.	All contract wey dem go award go dey fair and transparent, and expert inside and outside di government bureaucracy must evaluate am.
Allocations of plots must also be transparent.	Allocation of plots must dey transparent too.
No governor should be allowed to have absolute control of the treasury and it should be administered by competent staff.	No governor go get total kontrol of di treasury and na competent staff go dey in charge .
The governor should only be seen as the leader who guides institutions to develop and end one-man rule.	Di governor go be di leader wey go guide all di institution to develop and end one-man rule.
If the governor is liberated from this prison of power, he will lead the state to greatness.	If di governor dey free from dis prison of power, e go lead di state to greatness.
He will lead by example and corruption will be minimised because the avenues of abuse of power have been blocked.	E go lead by example and corruption go reduce becos dem don block all di way wey e fit use abuse power.
A governor should be seen to supervise public servants and ensure everyone performs his duties diligently.	Governor suppose dey to supervise public servants and make sure say everybodi do im duty well.
He should inspire his people with exemplary lifestyles, commitment to service and transparency.	E suppose inspire im pipo wit good lifestyle, commitment to service and transparency.

The reopening of four land borders by the Federal Government last week has significantly slowed down hoarding activities in Katsina markets, Daily Trust can report.	As di Federal Goment open four land borders last week don slow down keepkeep wey dem dey do for katsina, Daily Trust fit tok.
Prior to the announcement, grain merchants and other businessmen hid under the guise of company agents to buy farm produce in bulk and store to maximise profit in the near future.	Before dom shout am, pipo wey dey sell grains go disquise say dem be agent from company kom buy bigbig farm produce keep to store and get profit later. 
According to dealers, despite the restriction on the importation of rice and other food items, merchants were still skeptical to stockpile farm produce as government might change its decision anytime, depending on the circumstance on ground.	As one dealer take tok, despite say dem match leg ontop to dey carry rice and other food enter Nigeria , market pipo still get double mind to keep market ontop say goment  fit change dia mind anytime depend on wetin dey ground.
Alhaji Aminu Hussain, a sorghum merchant, said hoarding of farm produce was not a new business in the markets, but the practice seriously increased with the new agricultural policy of this administration and border closure.	Alhaji Aminu Hussain, wey dey sorghum, say to dey keepkeep market no be new tin for di  market, but e kom go up wit di new  agricultural policy of dis administration and border wey dem close.
Many of us made huge profits on farm produce last year, that is why our people came out early in this harvest period, mopping up the produce; but the recent reopening of land borders has slowed us down.	Many of us chop beta gain ontop farm produce for last year, na why pipo kom out quick dis harvest time to dey buy keep but border wey dem open don slow am down.
The fear among us now is that market price of food items will come down.	The fear wey we get na say price for food go still kom down. 
He added that the shortfall of farm output, occasioned by incessant activities of bandits this year, had also motivated the merchants to hoard the produce.	E add join say farm produces wey no kom out plenti bikos of bad way of dem bandit dis year, don give market pipo mind to keepkeep dia market.
Rice, maize and sorghum were the most targeted produce.	Rice, maize and sorghum n aim dem put eye.
Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana, a grain dealer at Bakori market, said the announcement of border reopening last week had made an impact on the market price of major food items.	Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana, wey dey sell grain for  Bakori market, say as dem shout to open border again  last week don get hand ontop price for major food for di market.
Unlike last year when, by this time, maize was between N8,000 and N9,500, sorghum was N7,000, they are now sold at N14,000 and N13,000 respectively.	E no be like last year we, by dis time, maize dey around N8,000 and N9,500, sorghum dey N7,000, nah N14,000 and N13,000 dem dey sell dem now.
The recent announcement of border reopening has crashed down the price of paddy rice from N14,000 to N12,000, sorghum from N14,500 to N13,000 and maize from N15,500 to N14,000.	Dis shout of open border again wey dem shout down spoil di price of paddy rice from N14,000 go N12,000, sorghum from N14,500 go N13,000 and maize from N15,500 go N14,000.
Tarzana added that most merchants withdrew from bulk purchase of the produce after the announcement, expecting that waivers for the importation of food items would follow anytime soon.	Tarzana add join say many market pipo comot hand to dey buy market bigbig afta dem shout am, get am for mind say di breeze from importation of food go enta anytime.
Our correspondent observed that there are mixed reactions to the land border opening.	Our news pipo see say di land border wey dem open again get many eyes. 
Majority of the farmers and merchants prefer the borders to be closed so that they would continue to exploit the numerous value chains of our local agricultural produce.	Plenti of di farmer and market pipo want make di border dey lock so dat dem go dey chop beta for di market wey we dey do for awa  house.
Consumers, on the other hand, welcomed the recent development, in anticipation that government would allow importation of rice and other food items.	Pipo wey dey chop am and some other pipo hapi wit di development and dey expect say goment go allow make dem dey import rice and other food. 
But their expectation was shattered by governments reiteration that rice, poultry, cooking oil and other food items remained banned from importation.	But goment kon fall dia hand as im tok say rice, chicken and turkey, oil for cook and other food still dey under ban to dey import. 
Sani Muazu Hunkuyi, an agric expert, enjoined the Federal Government not to bow to pressure and give waivers for food importation.	Sani Muazu Hunkuyi, wey be one agric expert, beg di goment make dem sumit give di pressure, allow food to dey enter. 
Government has invested a lot in the agricultural sector and we should not allow such huge investment to go down the drain by wavering food importation in this country.	Goment don invest plenti agric sector and make we nor allow dat big investment enta water wit breeze of importation inside dis kontri
It is true that there is palpable fear of food crisis, but we can mitigate that through irrigation farming.	Na true say fear for food crisis don burst evriwia, but we fit reduce am wit farming wit water.
Besides, food importation will only worsen the already economic recession the country is battling with, Muazu said.	To dey import food go make dis economic recession wey dey di kontri worst to tackle, na im Muazu tok
He added that farmers would be seriously affected if government reversed its policy on food sufficiency.	E add join say yawa go gas for farmers dem if goment cancel dia policy ontop to make food plenti.
Why flood-resistant rice is crucial to farmers	Why rice wey flood nor dey important to farmers dem. 
The threat to food security in Nigeria as a result of flood will soon be an issue of the past following the release of the FARO 66, a variety of rice that is resistant to flood.	Di threat ontop food for Nigeria bikos of flood go soon be tin of di past as dem release FARO 66, one type of rice wey flood no fit kari.
FARO 66, recently released to rice farming communities by the National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI), is a variety that has characteristics and traits that are different from what local farmers are used to.	 FARO 66, wey National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI) release give farming pipo dem be type wey get some tins wey dey different from wetin farmers for here sabi before.
This variety is taller than other ones known to the farmers.	Dis type tall pass other one wey farmers sabi.
With its height, coupled with effective ecological farming management, it is capable of withstanding the stress of flood to a larger extent.	Witi how im tall and some betabeta farming mata, e get power to survive palava of flood wella.
Acceptability of new varieties among farmers has always been a huge challenge, and the introduction of the FARO 66 is no exception.	To kolet new tins among farmers dem dey always be big problem and as dem introduce FARO66 no dey different. 
However, when fully embraced by the farmers, the threat to food security in terms of rice production would be reduced.	But if dem farmer kolet am finish, di threat ontop food about rice mata go reduce.
During this years Field Day, organised by the NCRI station in Birnin Kebbi, the capital of Kebbi State, farmers and other stakeholders were introduced to the new variety after a field trip to the institutes demonstration farm in the metropolis.	For dis year field trip wey NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, capital of Kebbi State organise, farmers and dem oga dey introduced to dis new type afta a field trip wey dem do for di institute demonstration farm for di city.
At the demonstration farm, farmers were exposed to FARO 66, which withstood the stress of the recent flood, side by side with the farm of other rice varieties that were washed away by the same flood.	For di demonstration farm, farmers dey expose to FARO66, wey stand gidigba wit flood inside farm and other rice follow di same flood waka.
The two farms, which are situated side by side, revealed the flood disaster tolerant capability of the FARO 66 variety, as despite all stress, it grew to maturity.	Di two farm wey dey near each oda show di power to tanda wit flood wey FARO66 type get, wit all di wahala, e grow and strong.
On the farm of the other rice variety, only the remnants of the rice plant could be seen.	One di farm of other type of rice, na di remaining of rice wey die remain dem see.
Speaking to our correspondent, the head of the NCRI station in Birnin Kebbi, Andrew Shema, said the FARO 66 variety could best resist flood if planted early.	As im follow awa  news pipo talk, di oga for di NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, Andrew Shema, say di FARO 66 go tanda wit flood if dem quick plant am.
He added that with its hard stem and height, if planted early, the variety could grow to a size that when flood sets in, the plant could resist the condition.	E add join say, im stem wey hard and as e tall, if dem part am quick, di type go don grow reach size wey be say if flood com, di plant nor go gree for am.
He said FARO 66 was released two years ago, but acceptability, as is the case with any new variety, must be gradual, noting that when it becomes widely accepted among farmers, flooding would not be a threat to rice farming any more.	He tok say FARO66 dey release two years ago but to kolet, as for di case wit any new tin, must be small small, tok say, if farmers dem don accept am wella, flood nor go be threat to rice farming again. 
According to him, to sensitise the farmers as research on the improved variety progressed, they were carried along to appreciate the processes and results recorded.	As im take tok, to open di eyes of farmers dem as research ontop dis new type dey go front, dem carry dem join bodi to see how e dey go and to record result. 
He added that the scientists on the research work were optimistic that if farmers were allowed to appreciate the ability of the plant to withstand flood, acceptance of the new variety among them would not only be fast but also effective.	E add join say science pipo wey dey ontop di research get sense say if dem allow farmers dem to see how dis plant fit take tanda wit flood, no be only to accept am go dey fast, to dey use sef go dey. 
Shema, who said lack of sufficient funding had been their major constraint in the research work, called on all stakeholders to invest in the initiative for a better tomorrow as research is not only limited to the development of improved varieties but also created jobs, as well as developed the economy of a nation.	Shema wey tok say as dem nor give dem plenti moni be dia major wahala for di research work, e call stakeholders dem to kom invest ontop dia idea for beta tomorrow as di research no go only develop di new type but e go still create job, and still develop economy for di kontri.
He explained that public lectures were also conducted as part of the day one Field Day activities, saying the essence of introducing public lectures in this years activities is to bring to the notice of stakeholders that research only comes to fruition with sufficient funding	 E explain say dem still do public lecture wey dey among program wey dem do for di first day of di field day wey dem do, e say why dem introduce public lecture join dis year program na to show stakeholders dem say nah if moni wey reach dey n aim research fit get head.
He appealed to well-meaning Nigerians and organisations to inject enough into research.	E beg pipo wey get mouth for Nigeria and organization to kom drop put for research.
The day two was on exhibition and application of technology in farming.	Di two days nah ontop to show how technology take enter farming
When we said flood-tolerant, we are not saying it will not be affected by flood completely.	Wen we tok say he dey tanda wit flood, we no tok say flood no go affect am patapata.
What we are saying is that with its characteristics and desirable trends, it would withstand flood stress to some extent.	Wetin we dey tok be say wit all di tin wey e get for bodi, e go tanda wit flood wahala reach one side. 
FARO 66 is tolerant to flood because it is taller than FARO 44 and FARO 52.	FARO 66 go tanda wit flood wahala bikos e tall pass FARO 44 and FARO 52.
Its stem is also harder than the other varieties.	Im stem still hard pass other one. 
Ecological management in term of timing for planting is key in resisting flood.	To manage sky as in to plant quickquick na im be di key to tanda wit flood. 
Early planting saves a larger proportion of the crop when flood sets in.	To plant quickquick dey save bigbig if flood come.
The moment rain starts, farmers dont need to waste time.	 If rain don starts, farmers dem no need to dey waste time.
They should immediately mobilise for planting.	Dis one go make crop dey strong and hold leg for ground wella before flood go com, as im tok. 
This enables the crop to have good vigour and be established well before the flood comes, he stated.	Dem suppose start to dey plant sharpsharp.

Sasakawa moves to cushion COVID-19 effects on farmers	Sasakawa dey do make Corona no get power ontop farmers dem
Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG 2000) said it had initiated a process through which farmers are linked with commodity buyers as a way of cushioning the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.	Sasakawa Global 2000( SG) don tok say im don find way wey farmers dem fit take colabo wit buyers to see say di wahala wey Covid-19 kos no get power ontop farmers dem
This was disclosed by the organisations research and training officer, Mr Benjamin Shamaki, during a media field tour they organised.	Na dis tin di research and training officer for di organization, Mr Benjamin Shamaki yarn inside one media field tour wey dem do.
According to him, Sasakawa has trained farmers in Kano and Gombe states on effective utilisation of the aggregator facilities, as well as linking farmer associations with prospective buyers to ensure value for their produce, as well as ensure quality of what the farmers are selling during the pandemic period.	As im take talk, Sasakawa don train farmers dem for Kano and Gombe state to dey use di aggregator facilities and to colabo di association of  dem farmer join wit buyer wey go give beta value, give dem wey dem dey plant and to see say wetin dem dey sell Corona time beta wella.
We have trained women farmer groups, not only in modern farming techniques but also on value addition to their produce.	We don train women wey bi farmer, no be for only new-school farming, but also to take give dia crop beta value.
We have encouraged them in the formation of associations, through which we successfully linked them up with buyers of their produce.	We don encourage dem ontop how dem go dey form association, ontop wetin we don successfully colabo dem wit buyers.
They also produced along the value chain of a particular crop, he revealed.	E tok say dem dey don still produce along di value chain of one crop
Similarly, the chairman of Bagwai Farmers Association, Malam Danladi Yahaya Bagwai, said farmers in the area were ready to make good use of the aggregator facilities provided for their agricultural sustainability by SG 2000, adding that they would ensure proper utilisation of the aggregator facilities.	As e be, di chairman for dem Bagwai farmer association, Malam Danladi Yahaya Bagwa tok say dem farmer for dat area dey ready to use di aggregator facilities wey SG 2000 give dem for dia agricultural stability wella, e add join say dem go see say dem use di facilities wella.
According to him the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed negatively affected farming activities in various states of the federation, including Kano.	As im take tok say Covid-19 don kos bad-market ontop farming for different different state for di kontri, for Kano too.
He added that without Sasakawas intervention, farmers in the area would have been out of business for long.	E add join say if no be for Sasakawa put hand, dem farmer for di area go don forget dia work tey tey.
He further revealed that during the pandemic, farmers in the area were assisted with improved seed varieties, fertilizer and pesticides, which he said had helped them tremendously during the period.	E still tok say for di pandemic time, dem give farmer for di area different different beta seed, fertilizer and otapiapia for plant wey im tok say e help dem wella for di time.
The chairman also stated that the introduction of an aggregator facility, which serves as service providers to eliminate some of the marketing effort issues in the area, had helped farmers to store and access their produce with ease, as well as sell with high market value.	Di chairman still tok say as dem carry aggregator facility cum, wey stand gidigba as dia help to comot some marketing palava for di area, don help farmers dem keep dia produce witout gbege and to sell for big price for market.
He said the aggregator facility had enabled farmers to collectively put their produce together in one centre and Sasakawa would connect them with mega companies that would buy the produce with value and in good market value.	E tok say di aggregator facility don help farmers dem gather wetin dem dey produce for one place and Sasakawa go help colabo dem wit big big companies wey go buy am for plenty money.
It has been on record that farmers in this area have been producing, but due to lack of proper marketing strategies, they usually ended up getting virtually small value of no value for their produce.	E don dey on record say farmers for dis area as dem no get marketing skil, e dey make dem get small value on top dia produce.
Sasakawa has established for us an effective aggregator centre, and it has equally provided us with the knowledge on how to effectively utilise this facility to increase our products market value.	Sasakawa don establish one aggregator centre for us,  wey dey give us wisdom wey we go take use dis facilities take make pipo buy awa  market wella.
No doubt our initial inability to put into practice a proper marketing strategy that will ensure effective gain in sale of our produce in the open market has negatively affected our productivity, he said.	E dey sure say as we no get marketing skil before wey go help us make moni wella for wetin we dey farm  don cause plenty kasala for us, na so im tok.
Similarly, according to the Sarkin Noma of Bagwai, Alhaji Bello Gurdo, in the irrigation site of Kano State, COVID-19 and its aftermath has made things harder for farmers.

He said the site, which is 1,562 hectares of land, had hundreds of farmers, both male and female working on it.	Im tok say di site we be 1,562 hectares of land, get hundred farmers, wey be man and woman wey dey do work on top am.
He added that the intervention received from SG 2000 had assisted the farmers to remain afloat during the period.	E tok am say di hand wey SG 2000 put am don help make di work of farmers dem dey berekete for di time.

As of today, the menace of illegal weapons in circulation in the land is a huge threat to our economic sustenance, unity and co-existence.	As im be today, di way wey weapon dem wey dey illegal dey  plenti evri wia na serious wahala  for economic sustenance, unity and to dey togeda.
It is in this that we discover the nexus between governance and millions of illegal weapons in circulation being a salient matter at this point of our national life.	Na inside all dis kasala wey we take sabi wetin di link wey dey between governance and di illegal weapon wey dey evriwia be,  wey be main mata for dis time of awa  national life.
The current drift and drain of governance in Nigeria in the last two decades have position many Nigerians to be conscientised by the practical experience of poverty of governance.	As Nigeria dey go up and down for di last two decades don make plenti Nigerians sabi wetin be di poverty governance.
Therefore, it is also very imperative for us to point out what governance entails in its simple sense, as well as in the context of this piece.	As e take be like dat, e go beta for us make we sabi wetin governance be for simple sense and wetin in be for inside dis context.
The Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Sixth Edition defines governance as an activity of controlling a country or the way in which a country or institution is controlled.	Di Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Sixth Edition tok say governance na di way wey dem dey control one kontri or di way wey one kontri or institution deu dey control.
Thus, governance involves a process of control and controlling activity in a country, including arms and weapons in circulation.	So, governance na di process of control and controlling activity wey dey a kontri join weapon wit im circulation.
Again, governance can be seen as the process whereby constituted official elements wield powers, authority and enact policies concerning public life and economic decision for overall social development.	Again, governance still fit dey look as di process wey dem goment  pipo dey hold power, authority and di way wey dem dey give policy wey pertain to pesin life and economic decision for di beta beta of di pipo.
However, this governance process takes the in-depth application of suitable and influential decision that impacts on the management and distribution of resources that includes revenues, man and materials.	As e be, to dey run di goment  go take make dem use decision wey dey good and wey go get good impact on top di management and di sharing of resources wey include moni, pesin and material.
Moreso, it involves the regulation, implementation and enforcement of desirable policies for target objectives, goals and aspiration through capacity.	 E go involve di regulation, implementation and enforcement for d policy wey pesin want, wey go be for objective wey get target, goals and aspiration through capacity.
Therefore, governance is simply controlling for desirable development result of which, safeguarding life and properties of citizens is key through exact regulations of arms and weapons is vital.	 As e be, governance  na to dey control di development wey pesin want, wey be say,  to protect life and property of kontri pipo tru d regulate of arms and weapon dem be koko.
However, many reasons are being advanced to explain the continued inexorable poverty of governance in Nigeria.	As e be so, e get plenty reason wey explain di poverty wey never stop since for governance for Nigeria .
For instance, poor institutional capacity leads to government failure, so also is the wider inequality, access to justice and fairness that create a burden of oppression and repression.	For example, poor institutional capacity na im cause goment  failure, wey no make  everything  balance in di wey dem dey do justice and fairness, wey cause oppression and jagajaga for mind.
In addition to this, is the ever-rising provocation of nepotism and bigotry, ethnic sentiment that amputate national cohesion in decision making, coupled with negligence on the part of political representatives.	To add join dis one, na as dem dey do ojoro dey help dere family dem, as dem dey selfish, ethnic partial wey don cut to dey togeda ontop decision making troway, and as di political representative no dey too do dia work.
The recent alarm raised by the Chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC) and former Military Head of State, General Abdulsallami Abubakar at a dialogue session of the committee with stakeholders at Transcorp Hilton in Abuja that over 6 million illegal weapons are currently traced to civilians, many of whom are jobless, hungry and angry.	Di mata wey di Chairman for di National peace Committee (NPC) and d former Military Head of State, General Abdulsallami Abubakar tok for Transcorp Hilton for Abuja say e pass 6 million illegal weapon wey dem fit trace to di kontri pipo, many of dem no get work and dem dey hungry and angry.
The number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.	Di nomba of di small small weapon wey dey Nigeria for di hand of kontri pipo wey no dey military reach 6,145,000 and armed forces and law enforcement pipo count dia own to be 586,000 weapon.
He went further to reveal the deplorable insecurity challenge in the country.	E still tok go front about di sekuriti problem wey dey di kontri.
Informing the nation that 80,000 Nigerians have died in recent months with close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) spreading across the country all because of growing dire insecurity and illegal weapons circulation in the country.	E tell all di nation say na 80,000 Nigeria pipo don die for recent month and like three million pipo  be Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) evriwia for di kontri bikos say sekuriti problem dey plenti and illegal weapon dem waka evriwia for di country.
He also added by saying that the security forces are not only overstretched but are under-funded, asserting that they can perform better with more sophisticated weapons, equipment and with accountable funding provided.	E kon tok say di sekuriti forces no just dey over work but dem no get moni, and e tok say dem fit do beta if dem give dem beta weapon, equipment and make dem give dem moni wey go dey accountable. 
The concern raised by the former head of state and the chairman of National Peace Committee (NPC) stands a reason to take governance seriously over the carnage in the land.	As di forma head of state and di chairman for National Peace Committee (NPC) take shuk mouth for di mata, e don show say we suppose take governance serious ontop plenty die-die tins for di kontri.
Incidentally, this has shown that even those who exercise power and authority are living in fear.	Wela, e don show say pipo  wey even dey power and authority dey live for inside fear.
It is in this context that they must pay heed to the cry of the people for help by taming the illegal weapon circulation.	For dis side dem suppose hear cry for help of d pipo make dem try reduce as illegal weapon dem waka evriwia.
Moreover, a recent report on arms proliferation in Africa tagged	For onetime dem tok say na for Africa weapon dey increase pass.
Small Arms, Mass Atrocities & Migration in Nigeria highlighted that arms proliferation gave rise to armed groups and also led to the displacement of several Nigerians.	Small arms, Mass Atrocities & Migration for Nigeria, tok say na as weapon too dey increase na im make bring gunpipo, n aim still kos di scatascata of many Nigeria pipo.
Conversely, the report stated that the proliferation of arms in Southern Nigeria has led to increasing violence in the region, such as communal clashes, cultism, kidnappings, ethnic and religious clashes, and militancy in the Niger Delta.	Di report tok say na as weapon dey plenti for  Southern Nigeria n aim make kasala plenti for area like village wahala, cult, kidnapping, tribe and religion gbege,  and militancy for di Niger Delta.
In the same vein, the report had it that in the Northern region, due to existing state corruption, large tracts of ungoverned spaces, and mass unemployment has been responsible for rising criminality and violence in the region.	And na d same way di report tok say for Northern Nigeria side, as per say corruption don plenti for dat side, dem get plenti land wey no get pesin wey dey rule am, and dem no too get work and na dis tins don make criminal and wahala mani for dia side.
The report opines that the aforementioned succeeded because of the proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).	Di report tok say wetin we tok before hapun bikos say Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) dey increase. 
The situation calls to question, the feasibility of the National Task Force on Small Arms and Light Weapon.	Di mata dey question di feasibility of di National Task Force on top Small Arms and Light Weapons.
Hence, we must chart the way forward, even though it looks blink and insurmountable.	So, we must to find di way to dey go front, even say e no dey clear and we no fit settle am.
We must rise to the occasion to tackle illegal weapon circulation in the country with the entire government structure confronting the menace headlong at federal, state and local government.	We suppose face di mata and tackle as di illegal weapon dey dey evriwia for di kontri wit all di goment  structure wey dey tackle di mata for di federal, state and local goment  level. 
Equally, the National Task force on Small Arms and Light Weapon and office of the National Security Adviser to the President (ONSA) must re-double their efforts in the fight against illegal arms proliferation through preventive and repressive engagement.	And as e be, di National Task Force for Small Arms and Light weapons  and di office of di National Sekuriti Adviser for di President (ONSA) must tight moremore to tackle di illegal arm wey don plenty wit to disturb and to stop am.
Succinctly, appropriate people-centred governance programmes and security policies are needed to incorporate not just community policing but individuals and group policing networks of intelligence sharing.	As e kon be like dis, we need program wey go teach how dem dey carry pipo for mind for governance and di sekuriti policy dey needed no be only community policing but policing for individual and group to dey share intelligence.
Essentially, transparency, accountability and responsibility are the key watch of governance, without this, eliminating illegal weapons in circulation is tantamount to fruitless exercise.	Di main tin na transparency, accountability and responsibility for beta governance, if dem dey, we no go fit comot all di illegal weapon wet dey evriwia.

Overpaid, oversexed and over here.	Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
That was the resentful and contemptuous opinion many British people came to have of the thousands of American GIs stationed in several military bases in Britain during the Second World War.	Dat na di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo get for di thousands of American GIs wey station for inside several military bases for Britain durin di Secon World War.
The gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising American soldiers frequently got into pub brawls and dangerous knife fights which built up a feeling of disdain for the yanks among the locals.	Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising  soldier dem wey from America comedey frequently get into pub fight and knife fight weu dey dangerous wey dey kos bad feeling for di yanks among di locals.

And dis don be di pattern wey America soldiers dem dey take behave evriwia for di hundred of America military base oversea from Okinawa for inside Japan, Stuttgart inside Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga inside  Philippines.
That is why I am perturbed, like many Nigerians, that in a virtual meeting last week with the Secretary of State of the United States of America, Antony Blinken, President Buhari was reported to have asked that the United States considers relocating the African Command (Africom) of its military presently based in the southern German city of Stuttgart to Africa.	Na why i dey upset, like plenty Nigeria pipo, say na for virtual meetin last week wit di di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, na dem report say president Buhari ask United States to consider as dem go take relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey for Stuttgart for inside southern German city of presently kom Africa.
It is presumed that with this call, President Buhari is making a pitch for Nigeria to host Africom.	We dey thingk am say wit dis kin call, president Buhari dey make way for Nigeria to host Africom.
In the first place, it was a breach of protocol for President Buhari to hold that meeting with the American Secretary of State.	For di first place, na breach of protocol for  President Buhari to do dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.
The meeting should have been with Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who would then transmit the details afterwards to the president.	Dem suppose do di meetin wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who o kom carri di detail go meet president later.
Yes, America is a superpower and all that, but protocol is protocol and should be followed strictly in all circumstances.	Yes, America na superpower and all, but protocol na protocol and dem soppose follow am strictly  for evri circumstance.
Understandably, Nigeria is currently faced with gargantuan internal insecurity issues which seem to defy the best efforts of government and the nation's security establishment in tackling it.	We understand say Nigeria dey face big internal security wahala wey be like say e pass di best effort wey goment and security establishment for inside di nation dey make to take tackle am.
Unrelenting terrorist insurgency in the North East, banditry, kidnapping in the North West, farmers/herders clashes all over the country and the targeted killing of security and law enforcement personnel and other Nigerians coupled with the destruction of institutional buildings in the South East, constitute the cocktail of insecurity now ravaging the country.	Terrorist insurgency wey no dey tire for di North East banditry, kidnapping inside di North West, farmers/herders clash dem all over di kontri and as dem dey target and kill security and law enforcement personnel dem and oda Nigeria pipo plus di destruction of institutional building for di South East, na dem join take be di cokctail of insecurity wey don dey ravage di kontri.
But even at that, the call for the hosting of the Africom on Nigerian soil when considered against the various issues and implications of this move to Nigeria is hardly justified.	But even at that, di call to take host Africom on top Nigeria siol when we consider m against various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria difficult to justify.
Africom is one of nine such commands by the American military establishment to exclusively serve American strategic interests around the world.	Africom na one amng nine of dat kind command wey di America military establish say make e dey serve America strategic interest around di world.
By their doctrine and operational modus, these commands, particularly those outside America like Africom, are not set up primarily to concern themselves with the security and law enforcement issues of their area of coverage.	By dem rule and way of operation, dis commands, particularly di ones wey dey outside America like Africom, dem no set dem up primarily to concern demselves wit security and law enforcement issuefor dem area of coverage.
They only do so when such issues directly affect American interests in the area and in such situations, they are not mandated to yield their modus operandi and share intelligence with the local security and law enforcement agencies.	Dem only do so when such issue dey affect di interest of America directly for di area and for such situation, dem no dey mandated to yield dem modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agancy dem 
If Africom is set up in Nigeria for instance, it will be an island of its own restricting access to Nigerians of all categories and establishing a jurisdiction within the territorial area of the base that will be virtually off limits to Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies.	If dem set Africom up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island on im ownas e go restrict access to Nigerians of all category and establishing a jurisdiction withing di teritorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off limit to Nigerian security and law enforcement agancy dem.
As it always happens with American military bases outside America, Africom will be a forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and source of acts of sabotage and destabilisation against the host country.	As e dey always apun wit America military base wey dey outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and e go source for act of sabotage and destabilisation against host kontri.
In the particular case of Africom, part of its original concept was actually to contain the growing strategic influence of Nigeria in West Africa and Africa following our successful peace enforcement efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone and our sterling records of peace keeping around the world.	For dis particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to kontrol as di strategic influence of Nigeria dey grow for West Africa and Africa as we get successful peace enforecement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa beta record of peace keepin around di world.
Africom's precursor was the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) set up by the Clinton administration to counter Nigeria's strategic interests in Africa.	Di one wey dey before Africom na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to take counter di strategic interest of Nigeria for inside Africa.
President Clinton's Secretary of State, the dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, made many secret and open visits to a number of African countries to sell the idea.	Di Secretary of State for president Clinton, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, be visit a nomba of African countries secretly to sell di idea. 
But because Nigeria was the target, he pointedly left it out from his itinerary.	But bikos Nigeria na di target, he pointedly komot am from im itinerary.
Senegal, which is not far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, was to be the coordinating base of the ACRI and though it was touted as an initiative to facilitate American assistance to African humanitarian issues, its secret protocols were unmistakably military and strategically targeted at Nigeria.	Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na im suppose be di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem see am initiative to facilitate assistance of America to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocol dem mistake for military and dem target Nigeria strategically.
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to the idea from France, which was averse to seeing the Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, the ACRI concept was reviewed.	Due mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, which was averse to seeing di Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di concept of di ACRI.
In the review, which drew the expertise of American military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions midwifed by the American congress in secret sessions, the Americans considered and realised the need to set up an African command to add to the other commands already in place covering the various continents of the world.	For di review, wey draw di expertise of america Military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di America congress carry kom for dem secret sessions, di Americans dem consider and realise di need to set up one AFrican command to add to di oda command wey don dey already and dey cover oda continent for inside di world.
Thus based on recommendations of these assemblage of experts drawn from all facets of American political and security establishments, Africom was set up by the Bush Junior administration with a wider mandate not just to contain Nigeria but also to keep an eye on the growing Chinese strategic penetration of Africa.	Thus, to follow on di reccomendation of experts wey gather, wey dem kom form all angle of political and security establishments for inside America, na di Bush Junior administration set Africom up wit mandate wey wide pass to contain Nigeria but also to keep eye on top di strategic penetration wey Chinese pipo dey do for inside Africa.
Africom will be to Africa what US Central Command (USCENTCOM), based in Florida, is to the Middle East and Asia, European Command (EUCOM), based in Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based in Florida, is to Latin America and the Caribbean.	Na as US Central Command (USCENTCOM) take be to Middle East and Asia, na so Africom go be to Africa, as e base for Florida, European Command (EUCOM), as e base for Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based in Florida, is to Latin America and di Caribbean.
Nigeria is already surrounded by French military presence in Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and Benin.	Di presence of French military don surround Nigeria already as dem dey for Niger, Cameroun, Chad and Benin.
The Americans also have a drone base in Niger.	Di America pipo also get drone base for inside Niger.
Adding Africom to the mix in Nigeria will amount to a complete capitulation of our strategic interest to both France and America.	To add Africom to di mix for inside Nigeria go amount to a complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America.
Bearing in mind that our strategic interests and profile in Africa do not always cohere with those of France and America, the hosting of Africom in Nigeria will be the equivalent of letting in the wolf into the chicken coop.	As we get am for mind say awa strategic interest plus profile for Africa no dey always follow wit di one for France and America, to host Africom for Nigeria go be di same thing like make we allow wolf enter chicken cage.
There is nothing in the present insecurity challenges facing the country that our armed forces cannot cope with.	Notin dey inside di insecurity cahllenge wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed forces no fit cope wit. 
This is after all the military force that eventually secured Liberia and Sierra Leone against a well-entrenched and organised army of insurgents in those countries from a long logistical supply line thousands of miles; the army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention but a few of the many gallant Nigerian soldiers who distinguished themselves in those operations.

It is regrettable that the military of Nigeria, having fallen from the high standards known of it, is struggling now to cope with the activities of non-state actors internally.	E dey regretable say di Nigeria military, don fall from high standard wey dem take know dem, dem dey struggle now to cope wit di activity of non-state actors internally.
But intrinsically and essentially, the Nigerian military retains the capacity and capability to defeat these threats to our national security given the right leadership, doctrine and motivation.	But intrinsically and essentially, di military for Nigeria still carry di capacity and capability to defeat dis threat to awa nationl security if dem get di correct leadership, doctrine plus motivation. 
We need all the assistance and cooperation that the Americans can give us if they are so willing.	We need all di assistance and coopration wey di America pipo fit give us if dem wan give us.
But despite our circumstances be arm-twisted into hosting the Africom in view of its antecedents and implications to our strategic interests, on our soil.	But as dem don hold us for hand to take host Africom with awa circumstance in view of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interest, for awa soil.

Why secession is not the silver bullet to Nigeria's challenges (II)	(II) Why secession no be di silver bullet to di problem wey Nigeria get (II)
The proponents of Nigeria's break up hinge their reasons on three main pegs; the 1914 amalgamation of the northern and southern protectorates which gave birth to Nigeria, the United Nation's charter on self-determination and allegations of lack of representation and marginalisation in the affairs of the country.	Di pipo wey dey do say make Nigeria break up put am on top three main reason dem; di amalgation of northern and southern protectorate for 1914 wey born Nigeria, di charter of sef determination for inside United Nation plus lack of representation and marginalisation for inside di affairs of di kontri.
The notion that the 1914 amalgamation which secessionist groups say was the foundational move from which most of the current challenges facing the Nigerian nation emanated need to be vigorously challenged and totally debunked.	The mind say na di amalgamation of 1914 wey secessionist group dey say be di foundamental move wey cause plenty inside di current challenge dem wey dey face Nigeria need make dem challenge welwel and debunk am totally.
In this regard, it will benefit us to know that there was an earlier amalgamation in 1906 where the Lagos colony which had been in existence in 1862 was merged with the southern protectorate.	For dis regard, e go benefit us to know say amalgation be don apun earlier for 1906 wia dem merge di Lagos colony wey don dey since 1862 wit southern protectorate.
Like the subsequent 1914 amalgamation which seems to enervate the secessionists, the 1906 amalgamation too was a forced one between unwilling entities which had little or no cultural similarities.	Like di 1914 amalgamation wey follow wey dey enervate di secession pipo dem, di amalgamation wey apun for 1906 too na force dem take do am between entity dem wey no dey willing and dem get little or no cultural similarity.
Pray what did the peoples of the coastal states in the Niger Delta region have culturally and historically with the Yorubas of the Southwest?	Wetin di pipo of costal state for inside Niger Delta region get culturally and historically wit Yoruba pipo of southwest?
What links historically and culturally do the Igbos in the eastern hinterland have with Yorubas for that matter?	Wetin be di historical and cultural link wey di Igbo wey dey for east hinterland get wit Yoruba for dat matter?
As far as can be deduced, the reasons for rejecting the 1914 amalgamation also suffice for the one of 1906 in that they were both a forcible measure against peoples of different historical and cultural backgrounds.	 As far as we fit see am, di reason to take reject di amalgamation of 1914 go reach for di one of 1906 on top say na force dem force di two against pipo wey get different history and culture.
Why then do the secessionists harp only on the 1914 amalgamation to press home their demands neglecting conveniently the 1906 amalgamation?	Why secession pipo dey only tok about di 1914 amalgamation to take press dem demand and dem dey neglect di one wey apun for 1906?
The reasons are simply because for their own narrow political narratives and ends which seek to justify a North versus South secessionist agenda the 1914 amalgamation narrative is more suitable.	Di reason dem dey simple bikos for dem own narrow political tok wey dey try justify North vs South secessionist agenda na di 1914 amalgamation enter am pass.
It would not make good strategy if they also have to cite the 1906 amalgamation which essentially, by import and effect, was similar to the one of 1914.	E no go form beta strategy if dem dey also tok about di amalgamation wey dey essential, by import and effect, and e dey similar to di one wey apun for 1914.
How would it look for instance if Oduduwa secessionists say that the 1906 amalgamation was the reason why Igbos who are of different historical and cultural background have come to  dominate the economic and commercial life of Lagos and as such the Oduduwans are seeking out of this marriage with the Igbos forced on them by the British?	How e go take look for instance if Oduduwa secessionist tok say na bikos of si amalgamation for 1906 di Igbo wey get different history and culture don kom dominate di economic and commercial life inside Lagos and as such di Oduduwa dey seek to komot for di marriage with Igbo wey di British pipo be force on top dem.
Or the Igbos claiming that the 1906 amalgamation was responsible for the skewered nature of economic infrastructure being concentrated in the Southwest which compels them (Igbos) to have to invest in the Lagos economic zone rather than the East at great inconvenience?	or di Igbo dey say na di amalgamation of 1906 kos the bad nature of economic infrastructure wey dem concentrate put for Southwest wey dey carry dem (Igbo) kom invest for Lagos economic zone rather than di East wey go dey convienient pass?
Another fallacy being peddled about the 1914 amalgamation which was purportedly signed by representatives of Nigerian entities, was that it was to expire after a hundred years meaning by 2014.	Anoda falacy wey dem carry concerning di 1914 amalgamation be wey Nigerian entity dem represent sign be say e supoose expire afta hundred years wey mean say na 2014.
That Nigeria is still existing after the expiry date of 2014 is something the secessionists are trying to instigate other Nigerians to agitate against and ensure the end of this expired contraption as they call Nigeria.	Say Nigeria still dey exist afta im expiry date na somethingg wey secessionist dem still dey try to instigate oda Nigeria pipo against and make sure say dem end of dis joinjoin wey don expire as dem dey call am.
Again this is as near a namby pamby narrative as it can get.	Again dis one na near tok wey no get leg.
By 1914 the British had established full and total control of the territory we now call Nigeria as all pre-existing entities such as they were had become subsumed under British rule.	By 1914 di British don get full and total kontrol of di territory wey we dey cal Nigeria now and all di entities as dem be don dey under British rule.
British colonial rule over Nigeria had been unquestionably established which made the amalgamation a purely administrative measure by a colonial overlord for which he did not need the permission of his subjects to carry out.	Dem don establish di British colonial rule on top Nigeria and na dat one make di amalgamation pure administrative measure by colonial overload wey im no need permision from im subject to carry am out.
In this regard the amalgamation could not have been time bound as claimed, and it was not.	For this regard di amalgamation no fit get time to expire as dem dey claim, and e no get.
If ever there was a time for the amalgamation to expire as claimed, it had to be at the end of the British colonial enterprise which at the time was not in the reckoning of the British.	If time ever dey for di amalgamation to take expire as dem dey claim, e suppose be for di end di British colonial enterprise wey be say at di same time no be British go determine am.
If there was a genuine document that contained the terms and condition of the 1914 amalgamation including the signatories representing various pre-existing Nigerian entities as well as clause stating the date of expiry, the onus is on those peddling such as basis for the break-up of Nigeria to present it as proof to us of their justification.	If any genuine document dey wey carry di terms and condition of di 1914 amalgamation wey include pipo wey represent various pre-existing Nigerian entities plus clause wey dey state di clause for di expiry, na di work od di pipo wey dey pray for Nigeria to break up to present am as proof.
In any case, even if such a document existed, with Nigeria's independence in 1960 it ceased to be valid because all entities in Nigeria at the time partook through their elected representatives to discuss and agree on terms to be part of the new country.	For any case, even if such document dey, as Nigeria take get independence for 1960 e no go dey valid again bikos na evri entity for Nigeria dey take part wit di representative wey dem elect to take discuss and agree on top di new kontri.
If an agreement such as being bandied about on the amalgamation existed and if the parties that took part in the independence talk agreed for its retention and inclusion in the independence constitution, it would have become a relevant constitutional and legal case for the secessionists to cite in their agitations.	If di kind agreement wey dem dey carry about di amalgamation dey anywia and if di parti dem wey follow tok about di independence agree to retain am and dem include am inside di independence constitution, e for don bikom relevant constitution and legal case for di secession entity to take cite dem agitation.  
On the issue of the UN provision on self-determination as cited by the secessionists for their action, it is important to bear two important points in mind.	On top di issue of di UN provision on sef-determination as dem take cite am for dem secession action, e dey important make dem get two important point for mind.
The UN is not a world government with executive powers to superimpose its will on national governments.	Di UN no be world goment wey get executive power to take stamp dem will on top national goment dem.
A country can invoke the principle of sovereignty to block the implementation of any UN resolution it considers in conflict with its national interests.	Kontri fit use di principle of sovereignty to take block any resolution wey UN make if dem see say e no follow dem national interest.
Although Nigeria is signatory to the UN charter including the provision on self-determination, it can and has the right to block any attempt by any group within it to break-up the country by latching on to that provision.	Although Nigeria follow sign to di UN charter wey di provision of sef-determination follow, e fit and dem get right to block attempt from any group withing wey wan break di kontri if dem use dat provision.
Thus even in the unlikely event of any break-away group in Nigeria securing UN support, Nigeria can within its sovereign rights stand against such a move.	Thus even as e dey unlike say any group break away from Nigeria and UN support am, Nigeria fit use dem sovereign right to stand against such move.
But what is more significant is that although the UN charter provides for self-determination, the UN places a great onus on seeking such to prove their credentials and case comprehensively.	But di thing wey dey more significant be say although di UN charter dey providde sef detrmination, di UN don place great onus to take seek dem credential and case comprehensively.
The process of seeking and eventually getting UN support for a self-determination bid is a very complicated and convoluted one which will take years to come to fruition and may not result in success ultimately.	Di process to take ssek and to eventually get di support of UN for sef-determination bid dey very complicated and covoluted one wey fit take year to set and e still fit no get success at di end.
Those seeking to invoke the UN principle of self-determination for their secessionist bid must first of all prove that they have the mandate of the people of the area they seek to represent through popular elections or referendum and not through the media or internet.	Those seeking to invoke di UN principle of sef-determination for dia secessionist bid must first of all prove say dem get di mandate of di pipo of di area dey seek to represent through popular elections or referendum and not through di media or internet. Di pipo wey dey try to evoke UN principle of sef-determination for dem secessionst bid must firts prove say dem dey do wetin pipo for di area wey dem dey represent want wit popular election or referendum no be through media or internet. 
They must also show proof that the area seeking to secede has been denied or does not have adequate representation at local, state and national levels of the government of the country.	Dem must to show proof say di area wey want do secession dem don dey deny dem or say dem no get adequate representation for local, state and national level of di goment of di kontri.

But di call neva dey sufficiently loud and equivocal: Di goment must cease to dey create any impression say e fit employ di plenty youth , make dem honest and communicate clearly say employment opportunity dem dey limited for di public sector wey fit dey komot from time to time.
