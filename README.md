# Lacuna Funded Project: [MasakhaNER](https://lacunafund.org/language-2020-awards/)


### Project Description



###  Adding a corpus to the project

It is better to have a folder for each language (folder_name is iso 693-3 letter code) which will have two files,
1) corpus with filename (iso 693-3 language code) e.g xho.txt
2) A readme file describing the number of articles sentences, and tokens in the corpus. If possible, please specify news categories for the articles, since we prefer a balanced dataset across different categories.
