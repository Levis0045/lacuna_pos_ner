So, we tok am say IPOB no sabi anytin about di killin wey apun.
To beging with sef, how Gulak dey take threatin awa mission wey don warrant make we kill am.
We no get anytin with am, and we no for don kill am.
To dey point hand for IPOB for dis kin barbaric act na just to divert attention away from di real pipo wey do am.
Na di same way wey terrorist wey wera security uniform dey take komit atrocities for inside south east, and dem go kom IPOB for dem crime, sekk of say dem wan spoil awa reputation.
Na opportunate wey dem don dey find for long be dis to take start anoda special military operation for inside Eastern Region to take more Biafra pipo wey dey innocent.
Instead make scurity pipo for do proper investigate on top di incident and things wey cause am, dem don face IPOB ova crime wey dem no do.
Shey IPOB get di informate for di movement of di late Gulak reach say make dem stop am for airport road?
Di group tok say make security pipo first investigate pesin wey host Gulak, dat one na Hope Uzordinma, and im political opponent, to establish if dem dey involve.
Dos wey kill Gulak no go escape punishment.

Presido, Buhari, for one statement wey in toktok persin, Garba Shehu, don express im outrage and disgust ova di heinous murder.
Di president, wey don show say di incident make am sad, tok say: I dey repulsed by di gruesome murder of Gulak wey dey premeditated by evil pipo, wey be say dem don detrmine to dabaru di peace, unity and teritorial integriti of awa kontri.
Make I kom warn say nobodi, or joinbodi wey dey do dat kind thing wey dey despicable go expect to go free. 
We go use evritin wey we get to see say pipo wey do dis kind calous and criminal thing go face justice.

We wan use dis medium to tell awa brother, Governor of Imo state, Hope Uzordinma say we dey with am.
We encourage am and oda Governor dem for South Eastern states to brace up, make dem confront di security wahala to take end bloodbath for dem lan.
Di enemy of di pipo dey always use weapon of fear to create disaffection.

We must face di enemy of di pipo, to see say we komot power for dem hand.
Dis one no be time to dey argue who sabi politiks pass.

Dem don point am out, wit som justification too, say sake of say dis kontrol and dominance work to dia advantage, Fulani political aristocracy dey always work against di attempt of oda  ethnic group for di enthronement of a just, equitable and inclusive Nigeria for all.
Even say dis accusation against Fulani don dey for years now, no time wey e dey more pronounced pass dis present time unda di administration of President Muhammadu Buhari wey be Fulani man.
Even say som go troway dis as part of di stuff of politiks for Nigeria, di claim say Fulani dey kontrol and retain large amount of political power in a way wey e affect and komot odas, no dey totally wrong. No be lie say di Fulani political aristocracy don find way to prolong dis kontrolthroughmago-mago agenda of exclusive empowerment and appointment for di strategic areas of di kontri polity and economy.
Dis fulanisation agenda, as we expect, don turn oda ethnic group includin Hausa wey be di closest, against di Fulani, especially as dem don point am say na Fulani bin dey responsible for di banditry, kidnappin and oda violent crimes for North-West of di kontri.
In di current situation wey Nigeria dey, e no dey feasible again for Fulani to kontinue dey exercise di skewered and large kontrol of political power.
Dis no go only create a dangerous imbalance in di polity; e go also bring up a feelin, and tendency by di ethnic groups wey dem komot for politiks, to find ways wey dem go take disrupt di polity as we dey get am now.
For Nigeria to kommot for di dangerous situation of doubt wey dey build up currently, we must to address di issue of a bias political and economic kontrol of Nigeria, wey di powerful and influential ethnic groups dey show, to di exclusion of odas.
Anoda mata wey hang around Nigerian politiks and governance like burden wey dey pesin neck, get to do wit awa dangerous attachment to ethnic and religious ways, and awa effort to interpret evritin for awa kontri along dose lines.
We no be Nigerians for di true sense of di word.
Awa sense of togedaness as Nigerians to a large extent dey defined only by di land wey join all of us togeda rada dan by di value and identity wey we share togeda.
Na base on my-pipo, una-pipo and my-religion una-religion level we take dey relate wit eachoda, rada dan as Nigerians wey we all be. 
Di proclivity to play di ethnic and religious card don becom so pervasively sef-perpetuatin to di extent say wia e no even dey necessari, we go try to invoke am jus to assure awaself say dis na di normal tin to do.
If my-pipo, una-pipo card no wok, we go use my-religion, una-religion card, and for wia dat wan no work, we go use di my-pipo una-pipo own. 
We don too biliv dis factors as yardstick for almost evritin wey we do, sotey like addict wey dey deceive e sef on di happiness of takin substance, we just fit no gada di courage to kick di habit. Even say we sabi how harmful e be to awa bodi politic.

Reason why Zuba fruit market need kia-kia intervention.
For traders and farmers wey dey sell fruit and vegetables in di kontri, di Zuba international market, as dem dey call am, na major selling place.
No be only di Federal Capital Territory (FCT) dis market dey serve but all di states wey dey around too.
No be lie say di market na wia thouands of pipo dey see moni, most of dis pipo be women and small pikin wey dey buy and sell fresh produce inside and around Abuja wey be di nation capital.
Na plenti tonnes of fruits like orange, pawpaw, banana, plantain, pineapple, coconut, watermelon, vegetable and odas, dey enta di market evriday.
Awa tori-pesin wey go di market on Tuesday see say buying and selling plenti for imported apple and coconut business, and di market na major wholesale ground for people wey wan re-sell. 
Na dis market over 70 percent of di fruits wey dem dey chop inside di FCT and states wey dey around dey from kom. Pipo gada as earli as 5am evriday to do business.
Plenti tonnes of plantain na im dem display to sell in di market on Tuesday.
Even say dis market get big potentials to strengthen di agric business locally and internationally, e get plenti challenges wey don dey for many years.
Di market still dey very rough, and na dirty ground dem dey put all di fruits. Dis dey make pipo worri on di health implication, especially as di kontri dey follow di rest of di world fight COVID-19  disease.
Also, na di same place dem dey pack fresh fruits and rotten ones put, and even di ones wey be wastage wey don get germs and diseases.
Plenti pipo also dey open to germs wey dey cause diseases becos of di dust from many legs wey dey walk for di dirty environment.
Again, di lack of necessary tins like cold room, gud road, water, standard shops, clean ground wey dem go dey put di fruits, and odas dey increase pipo concern on how safe di fruits dey, and e dey put evribodi wey dey chop fruits for Abuja and nearby at high risk.
But even as dis challenges dey so, activities for di market dey put moni for many pipo pocket, and e dey generate revenue for di government too.
Awa tori-pesin follow som farmers and dealers who don dey do business for di area for plenti years tok.
Tarsoo Alex, who get orange farm for Vandikya, Benue State, tok say e supply more dan 60 bag of orange to di market on Tuesday.
But na about five bag e loose becos of too much heat, wey di plenti sun cause.
E dey fear say if buyers no kom early, e fit loose more.
As e tok, 1 bag of orange na between N6,000 and N7,500, but im profit don too reduce becos of transportation wey cost from im farm for Benue to Zuba.
To stop di issue of wastage, e tok say plenti of di farmers don dey use jute bags, wey go allow air enter, instead of nylon bag wey go cause plenti heat for di fruits.
Unlike orange, plantain dey evriwia now becos na di season be dis, one young man wey go like make dem call am just Pastor na im tell awa tori-pesin dis.
E tok say befor aftanoon, dem go don buy all di plantain finish.
E dey help farmers sell dia market.
Na for dozen  (12 bunch) dem dey sell am, and na between N5,000 and N8,000, as each one big reach. 
Na grade by grade dem dey select Watermelons, from grade 1, 2 and 3, and na 50 pieces dey for each dozen.
Dia price also depend on d grade, u fit get di smallest one for N9,000.
Regular customer fit get am for lower price.
Na di same way dem dey sell pawpaw and pineapple, but na for bag dem dey sell coconut, while na for carton dem dey sell apple, but na grade dem dey grade am too.

Di director of MURIC, Professor Ishaq Akintola na im tok  am on Sunday.
He tok dis one afa di warnin wey  PFN give say make any group no use di review of constitution wey senate dey do carry shariah law enter south-west.
PFN and oda Christian joinbodi know say shariah be dey for south-west before christianity enter for 1842.

Instead make PFN tell di joinbodi wetin  di christians dem want, na wetin dem think say make di christians no ask dem dey tok.
Dem wanuse am block muslim pipo wey dey for south, but e no go work.
E tok say as dem dey tok say religious tolerance dey for south, say na lie, and dem dey tok am to put Yoruba pipo wey be muslim for inside slavery.
Muslim pipo wey dey for di region don dey open eye, kom dye ask for freedom.
we deamnd say make dem stop as dem dey force us to dey wear christian school uniform, to dey go christian school, to dey use christian law.
we want shariah wey no dey cut pipo hand, but di shariah wey go dey regulate muslim marriage dem, inherritance and family affair dem.

He tok say di importation of feed grade maize go  sustain di ova 500 million layers, 100 million broilers, 1 million breeders and oda class of poultry  until next harvest.
He also urge government say, for di main time, make dem no allow dem to export soya, seed and soya bean meal wey dem don process.
He beg governors for di region make dem pu effort for di production of maize as dem do for di production of rice.
Odunsi put mouth say maize farmers, soya bean farmers and di ones wey remain for Naija need to collabo to take work.
He tok say if government no intervene, say scarcity and hish price of maize and soya go threaten anoda five million poultry jobs if government no do anytin about am.
Today, na 210,000/MT dem dey sell maize for inside most state for South West, soye bena na 240,000/MT.
As di two item take important reach, di price for poultry feed just dey increaese from from N2750 to N3000 for April N2020 to N4850 to N5300 now.
For December, most farmer no fit sell dem broilers bkos of di cost of production don pass wetin ordinary Naija pesin fit buy.
Presently, egg don dey pass wetin average pesin fit buy, di price na around 1,300
so we really need make goment intervene to save di remaining ten million jobs for inside di poultry value chain for di economy.

How North-Central govs dem fit optimize open grazing ban from South APC leader
As open grazing controversy don trend enter public domain, wey Southern governor dem don hit am with ban  durin dem meeting inside Asaba, di president, Farmers Empowerment Association in Nigeria (FEAN), plus Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) North-Central Forum in FCT, Honourable Obaje David, don examine how di North-Central governors fit respond to di ban.
Recently, di  governor dem for Southern state be meet for Asaba, Delta State, and dem ban open grazing to take cut farmers-herders crisis plus includin oda form of criminality dem.
Wetin be your take on top  di  controversy wey dis  decision generate?
evri human being get right for action and opinion.
But di most important thing be say once you take your own action, make you know consequence go dey.
You suppose fit consider di advantage and disadvantage.
I no be one of dose wey go tok say e good or e bad.
As a Nigerian, na your  right and liberty to live for anywia for inside di kontri with good faith and enjoy di freedom of association.
For  dis basis, I no go tell you say na good thing.
But as a leader for North Central, I go tok say na good thing, especially for North central zone, as per di potential economic benefit for us and di nation.
Di ban na advantage to us.
We need to tap into it and see how we fit make am real venture and make money from am.
Luckily for us, we get a landmass wey dey enough to accommodate di herder dem, no matter di nomba wey troop from di South enter di North Central.
Wetin beyour position about open grazing?
I no be one of di pipo wey dey support open grazing.
I believe more in ranching, bikos na im I de do.
I believe say if we begin do ranching, e go work out for us.
Make di governors for  North Central allow di national programme on top ranching.
Dis kind move fit make Nortj Central di place wey cow plenty pass, wia pipo fit dey buy cow and some allied products
E go kom bikom means of economic empowerment, for north central pipo.
We get di land wey southern states dem fit no get.
See for Kogi, Niger, Kwara, plus oda state dem. 
We fut give di herder pipo house, and ranch make e for be awa own advantage.
Di challenges wey dey follow di Fulani herders no be bikos dem no wan adopt ranching.
Di problem be say dem no really educate dem on top di advantage.
Dem culture dey nomadic.
As aresult, dem need beta education make dem for accept ranching.
We fit also adopt di method for Kenya, wey almost all family get cow, but you no fit  still see open grazing, as cow take plenty there reach.
Na wetin di southern governor dem dey tok be dat.
Di governor dem no show wia dem belong  in dis regard.
Dem no call for ranching or to say make federal government for put mouth.
Wetin dem dey tok be say di herder pipo don bikom problem for us, and make dem komot.
Dem tok say make herders kom apply for land, say herding na personal business.
But shey dem don ask dem pipo to apply for land like di herders?
As one of di pesin wey join for youth empowerment, especially for agriculture and value chain waka, why some government policy no really work, wetin be di way out?
Firstly, no other administration don touch  able to touch di lives of individual like one of President Muhammadu Buhari, wey you fit sit for your house without wahala and apply for facility and you go get am.
Also some credit facility wey dem dey call COVID-19 loan sef dey.
Many Naija pipo don dey collect di loan for plenty hundred of thousands of naira from inside of dem house without sat dem dey go offices.
Also, with say dem don dey expand some SMEs like di Bank of Industry (BOI), Bank of Agriculture (BOA) and di remaining.
Di challenge be say, we get two sides, dos wey go believe you and dos wey no go believe.
So, for dos wey no get believe for di administration of Buhari, notin get benefit.
But for us wey believe in Buhari, we dey benefit, and we thank god for am.

Di forensic Bill wey National Assembly wan pass: E dey relevant to di fight against corruption wey Buhari dey do

As dem don pass dis bill, di 9th Assembly under di distinguished and able leadership of His Excellency, Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON and Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiala don show clearly say, say dem don carry dem legislative function for head, as e take be for inside di Constitution of di Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as dem take amend am.
And dis also attests to di fact say di National Assembly don wake to di performance of dem complementary role with oda arms of Goment for di fight against corruption.
Na wit hapi mind  and wit deep sense of gratitude dat I write dis, which has been put togeda as a platform for us to let Nigerians and indeed the whole world know what di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria is all about and di unique concept we are bringing on board in order to complement national efforts in its quest to ride di kontri of corruption, fraud and Cyber-Crimes and oda related crimes.
Afta di senate dem don pass di Bill, and for view say na bi-cameral Legislature we dey operate, di  House of Representatives we dey always ready and resilient, under di able leadership of His Excellency, Rt.
Femi Gbajabiamila, wey  be di Hon.
Di speaker sef follow wetin dem do and he pass di Bill on Wednesday 19th May, 2021.
As una fit don hear before, di Bill wey dem wan take establish di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (CIFIPN) dey among di bill wey dem don tok NO to for inside National Assembly.
Di sad thing be say na pipo wey suppose dey put mouth for di fight against corrupt waka for inside Naija dey attack di bill, dem don turn to enemy for common ood.
Gud thing na gud thing, e no get substitute, na so bad thing sef be.
No mata as e take long reach, good go always prevails ova bad just as di light superior ova darknes take dey constant and unquestionable
e dey important say say make we see small of how e take happen for di National Assembly.
E dey interestin say, di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria (Est) Bill 2021 (CIFIPN) na di 9th Senate first pass am into law  on di 2nd day of March, 2021 as e done pass di  legislative processes of 1st Reading, 2nd Reading and eventual for di 3rd Reading on di 2nd March, 2021 senate dem pass di Bill  into law  wit one voice when dem don consider di urgent need  for di noble legislation, of kos no be sauy e apun without plenty  thunder bolts from detractors  wey no go stop at any lenght to see say any legislation wey go help di administration wey Buhari lead to fight corruption no see see light of day but senate stand welwel and dem see am through. 
E dey very important for make public know say (CIFIPN) no be just any noble bodi but a new one for Naija wey dem target say make e bridge di gap wey don dey for long for di forensics space.
Today, di waka to get one standard bodi wey go dey regulate di practice of forensics for Naija for im peak and make Naija pipo rise make dem challenge di few anti-goment bodi wey fit intend to sabotage dis step. 
Dis bill wey National Assembly don pass, show say clearly dem demonstrate say dem dey patriotic and di need to strengthen national efforts against corruption, wey don stand dey block development for evri aspect of awa national live.
Dis beta step for inside legislation , wey di two Chambers of di National Assembly take, dey historic and symbolic, e dey happen at a time wey Nigeria dey need legislation welwel.
dat one go give beta way for im anti-corruption drive as di spate of criminal and corrupt waka don rise across di globe.
As we all sabi, crime don enter anoda level as science and technology don improve for 21st century.
Therefore, as dem pass di bill dey gud and e apun for beta time, plus e don show clearly say we get flexible and responive legislature wey sabi di thing wey dey apun for di world, and dem dey redi to do legislation wey go meet wetin Nigeria pipo dey talk.
Make we also tok say di journey wey dey for inside as dem take pass di bill make e for turn to law, don start since di 8th National Assembly, wia Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan Ph.D, CON wey be current Senate President sponsor awa bill, when he be senate Leader, bikos e dey important to di anti corruption waka of dis admiistration.
For beta understandin, when we be introduce awa bill for inside di two chamber durin di 8th Assembly, dem do public hearin wey carry evribodi along for inside di chamber.
Thereafter, and ontop say minority pipo wey be stakeholder oppose am, na Institute of Chatered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) lead dem, di National Assembly pass di bill, with view of how e take get significance and di part wey go play for di fight against corruption.
Afterward, dem forward di bill give oga Presido, make e for put hand, but e neva put hand before dem scatter di 8th Assembly for inside June 2019.
Na on dis stregth dem take bring di bill abck for di 9th National Assembly, na Distinguished Senator Abdullahi A. Yahaya, di current Leader for di Senate, in view of as e take dey important.
We dey pushed to make dis clarification in order to clear di air on di cheap cheap propaganda wey pipo wey dey distract us dey tok say di 8th Assembly don reject awa bill.
 Also we suppose mention di fact say dem don mistake awa bill with abother bill dem wey dey similar wey dem just introduce for both di senate and House of Represntative Chambers. 
Dis bill dem, as we don scrutize dem with close eye, we discover say dem just copy awa intention and di thing wey awa bill stand for.
We suppose draw hear tok am say dem no introduce any of di bills dem for inside 8th Assembly, na only awa bill.
As such, na we be di first to carry bill wey big reach like dis (Forensic)
As we don see say e dey very urgent to establish dat kind great Institute.
Dem take di decision wey dem take establish di Institute afta dem study how di Institute dey take operate for other jurisdiction and how dem don take help crime detection, investigation and prosecution.
Na part of instruction make dem for know say awa Institute don dey since 2009.
And over di years, And over di years, we don train professionala to sabi forensic science technology, targeted at inculcatin di requisite skil dem for di pragmatic areas of forensic investigation and management, to wit:
 make dem fit take forensic analysis eliminate material misstatement, whether na by error or fraud; voice recognition analysis; fingerprint/signature analysis; digital forensic and cybersecurity; crime scene investigation; global anti-corruption compliance and enforcement; litigation support, forensic investigation capacities, preparation of forensic reports, fraud risk management, corporate fraud analysis, fraud prevention, detection and investigation etc.
You go follow me reason say for inside di obodo world wey we dey today, di normal way wey we dey take investigate crime, on to say we want stop am don bikom old something.
As such, make we as a kontri for do something wey get meanin for dis matter, e dey paramount say make we follow global trend and new innovations, wey dem put for ground to take fight corruption.
Na dis kind way we take reason to establish dis Institute wey get betta objective dat is relevant to di anti-corruption agenda of dis administration.
Time no too dey for me to tok about evrithing wey dey inside di bill for here.
However, I wan make you allow me to mention few of wetin di Bill go do, for di purpose of dis tok, as e take be like dis:
say make we for establish Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals in Nigeria, to develop and train professional for inside dis specialised field, with systemic and professional examination and certification wey go give better skil inside use of science and technology for fraud detection, investigation and detection;
To provide platform wey dem go dey take train and retrain of pipo wey wan bikom professional on top how dem dey take use Forensic Science and Technology tools and techniques dey investigate fraud for both public and private sector of di economy, as dem dey take do evriwia;
To promote high professional standards, ethics and etiquettes among pipo wey dey do di, in a bid to cut fraudul and corruption waka, and as well develop a mechanism for fraud prevention, as a proactive measure against corruption generally;  
To take fill di huge vacuum wey dey exist for awa  normal system of investigation weu don old with di introduction of a unique operation of forensic science to help di country from expending im scarce foreign exchange to hire foreign expatriates to do forensic investigations for inside Naija; 
To develop broad-based mechanism and training programmes wey go cut across all di strata of awa investigation architecture, involving professionals such as Lawyers, Criminologists, Security Experts, Judicial Officers, Court Registrars, and Economists. 
Dis one go enhance effective plus efficient disposition of cases as dem dey take do am globally; and
To take enhance anti-fraud mechanism for Naija, through di provision of a legal framework for di professional development and discipline of forensic and investigative professionals for Naija, among odas.
From di foregoing, e don show say di role of dis Institute dey strategic and important.
E also dey important make we tok say forensic science dey very wide and na field wey involve many oda, and e require effective and efficient regulation make we for attain and sustain high level professionalism and ethical standard.
Di broad spectrum of di scope and focal point of di Institute, includes but no be only forensic toxicology; forensic investigation; forensic auditing; digital forensics and cybercrimes, forensic autopsy; forensic law; forensic accounting; forensic nursing; forensic pathology; forensic engineering; forensic psychology; forensic DNA analysis; forensic anthropology; forensic linguistics; forensic deontology; forensic dentistry; forensic archeology; forensic graphology, forensic entomology, etc.
Accordingly, you go agree say awa Institute don bring unique concept enter crime detection and investigation wey follow international best practices.
Di concept pass as myopic pipo dey take thingk about awa bill don cover dem sense of thingkin, due to narrow-mindedness and inordinate desire to monopolise a system, wey don pass dem jurisdiction and scope of operation.
 On a lighter note, I wan draw di attention of evrione to di funny scenario dat is playin out now, and as a matter of fact, e suppose be a source of concern for all beta Naija pipo.
Wen dem introduce di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill for di 8th National Assembly, di Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), kom out wit anger to oppose di passage bikos according to dem, na unnecessary duplication of function wey dem Institute don dey do. 
However, as dem don take introduce awa bill again for dis 9th National Assembly, and as we don see di overwhelmin and accelerated legislative support wey di two Chambers don give awa bill, ICAn don realize say forensic science na uniques field of practice, and as we dey talk, dem don bring similar Bill kom meet di House of Representative, as dem don fail wofully for dem attempt to stop di passage of dis awa bill. 
One fit ask, wetin don change between now and di past, wia ICAN get di view say make any oda Institute no dey regulate di practices of forensic science?
Your answer na di same thing with my own.
I for also like inform you say di Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), also dey part of dis di episode.
 which was initiated and being promoted by ANAN. Just as dem ICAN counterpart, dey sef don introduce one bill for inside House of Representative wey di same structure with di Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria Bill, wey be na ANAN initiate am, and na dem promote am.
I decide say make I tok all di fact dem make Nigeria pipo and even international community for understand di extent to which some pipo fit go say make dem for achieve dem aim.
However, dis development no disturb us at all, bikos we believe ontop credibility and ability of di National Assembly and also for di Presidency to do di correct thing, make dem no enter manipulate in any way, with dis unnecessarydistractions dem, make dem for no make mockery of do whole thing.
Na ICAN be di practical and antagonist for dis bill and we don dey see di reason now. 
Dem engage several bystanders into make dem write bad petition, dem even target di leadership for inside Senate, and e sound like say na bleckmail.
As dem don fail for inside Senate, di antagonist shift attention go House of Representative with di same bystanders as dem just dey write many many publication.
and again, dem fail.
Ordinarily according to legislative procedure, bill wey Senate don passgo only need concurrence by di House except wen dem get observation.
But for di case of di CIFIPN Bill, di pipo wey dey against am fight am until truth win for 19 day of May, 2021 wey House of Representative pass di Bill establishment of the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria for Effective Regulation, Registration of Members and Determination of wetin di Standard Knowledge and Skil dem wey pesin wey wan bikom rigistered member must get and Qualify to Practice as Forensic and Investigative Professionals; and for Related Matter (HB. 791)
ICAN don register dem own Bill for inside di House of Respresentatives wey dem title  (REPEALING AND RE-ENACTMENT OF ICANS ACT.
Di new Bill wey ICAn bring get contain full provision to dey take practice forensic, plus say dem wan establish forensic university for inside Nigeria, and without am, nobodi go fit practice forensics for Nigeria, and pesin wey violate am go enter prison for some years.
Dis wan dey strange for ear for inside kontri wey plenty oepn eye pipo dey.
D tin wey make me api be say Nigeria no be Banana Republic
No mata di level of coruption wey dey dere.
We don dey challenge as House of Representatives take pass bill.
We suppose note am say, as we dey challenge di bill no be for bad belle, but bikos say we dey certain say di purpose of di bill na to stop presidential assent under di disguise say similar legislation don dey before.
We no go gree make dem deceive us and Naija people with dem wayo.
You go remember how ICAn take open eye oppose di CIFIPN and for inside one pubication wey dem sponsor by di Association of professional Bodies of Nigeria led by Engr.(Chief)
Olumuyiwa Alade on 24th May, 2019 make plenty effort to tell us say di law wey dey enable ICAN don give am power to do forensics and to pass di CIFIPN Bill go be like dem just dey duplicate law, but today ICAN don dey present dem law say make dem for include forensics inside di new law. 
Di question is, wetin don change?
Di same law wey ICAN wey ICAN don tell di public say e get forensics kom dey seek say make dem re-enact am.
As always, as we no dey oppose any group wey dey propose say make dem include forensics fot dem law, awa concern be say make one bodi no try perpetuate imsef.
ICAN and dem cohorts don realise dem inability to stop di passage of CIFIPN 
So dem wan get one union for demsef.
Na checks and balances dey fear dem, dem no go want want make anoda professional bodi to investigate dia activities bikos dem know wetin dem dey do to di economy of dis nation.
How dem go wan dey judge dem own case by demsef?
Dis one sound strange welwel.
On dis note, we dey  call on di National Assembly to beware of di wayo wey dis group get, dey no suppose dey talk from both sides of dem mouth,make dem kom dey  expect to use am cajole National Assembly.
Once again, we wan appreciate di commit wey di 9th Assembly put to make sure say dem pass di Bill, Naija pipo don know say dis administration dey ready to fight corruption by evri means and dem go encourage legislation wey dem aim say fit help dem achieve dis goal
We get confident say His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari no got hesitate to put hand for di Bill as soon as e enter im table
We dey call Naija peipo make dem kom take part for Forensic Profession.
Di profession dey open to all professional pipo for different area dem.
Di Institute get trainig section wey go guide and equip una.
I wan thank all of una, and also talk am again say we dey commited to stand with ethical standards as e take follow di way dem do am worlwide, as we dey give awa professional services, plus trainin wey go give us new ways to take fight corruption and crime wey be money matter generally.
I wan appeal give stakeholders and better Naija pipo say make dem support dis noble course, and to beg all of us to make efforts, so dat we go fit finish corruption together, di plenty security wahala, all ova di kontri and oda crises wey follow am.

Tela Maize harvest get potential to give 8 tons for inside one hectare
For di Tuesday wey just pass, di Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), for Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, be invite relevant stakeholders, plus journalist, to kom witness di third harvest of di Tela Maize Variety Confined Field Trials (CFT) under im Tela Maize Research Project wey di  Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) dey fund.
Dem derive di name for di maize variety TELA for Latin TUTELA wey mean protection.
Dis kind maize na im get protection against pest and draught for im breed.
Professor Rabiu Adamu wey be Principal Investigator, plus oda scientist wey carry journalists round d harvest, tok say di idea of di project na to produce maize variety wey dey resistance or wey dey protected against two major insect pest: stalk (stem) borers and Fall Army Worm plus another protection against moderate draught.
Dis is all about producing crops that are high yielding under stressed conditions; di stresses are Fall Army Warm and stem borers, which are major constraints to maize production. Na to dey produce crop wey dey yield welwel under hard condition wey dey do; di stresses dem be Fall Army Warm and stem borers, wey be major block to maize production.
If dem no control am, if fit cause loss wey reach 80 percent, plus drought if you no manage rain shortage welwel, you fit no get any yield.
Na di third time be dis wey don do dis trial,
Na for under dry season for march we do di first trial, and durin di rainy season, we do anoda one from june go enter November.
Na di third trial be dis from November go enter April.
Di Principal researcher tok say na wetin dem dey try showcase be dat.
As di three CFT trial don dey successful, pipo wey dey do research go need to test and validate dem to show say wetin dem record for inside dem research station dey perform well for inside di farmers field for different locations and ecological conditions as e go start for di rainy season of 2021.
By di time wey 2022 go end, if all tins dem work wel, Naija farmers go expect say make all dis hybrids dem dey wit dem.
Dr. Muhyideen Ayekunle, wey be maize breeder under dis project tok say from di two trial wey dem do last, di transgenic variety wey dem record give 17 percent advantage ova di one wey no get BT despite say dem don infest am welwel.
We don infest di varieties wey we dey put for trial three times unlike di previous one make we for take look how di BT gene take dey effective reach for di maize product.
With di outcome, researcher dem don tok say di yield go increase reach 17 percent.
So afta, we go analyze di data, and go prepare document to take get approval for environmental release.
We go submit di dossier give National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) and dem go review am.
Once dem give us approval say dis product, we fit show face for outside
and then we go fit get national performing trial.
Di  Director General/CEO of di National Biotechnology Development Agency (NBDA), wey be Professor Abdullahi Mustapha, for di event, call di scientist  dem to dey kontinu to search for abiotic and biotic solution to di challenge wey dey face farmers for inside di kontri. 
We don test some technology wey dey capable of providing solution to problem wey farmer dem dey face, make we take advantage o am and move forward, as im tok.
Dr Rose Maxwell Gidado, wey be di Country Coordinator OFAB Nigeria, tok di impact go plenty welwel.
Farmer dem yield go increase by 17 percent and you know say na productivity and harvest be di koko for farming.

LG polls: dem begin protest ova as dem take dey impose candidate for inside APC
Some member for di All Progressives Congress (APC) for inside Ogun state don do protest against how di parti take adopt some consensus candidate for some local goment area  ahead of di July 24 local goment election for inside di state.
Top pipo for di parti don announce say di parti go adopt consensus candidate for some local goment area, and dem go conduct direct and or indirect primary votin make candidate take emmerge for some.
Di protesters dem wey enter di secretariat of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), for inside Ogun State, be accuse some leaders of APC for Abeokuta South LGA say dem impose a candidate for di post Chaiman put for dem.
Dem carry placards wey dem write many many things put wey include We Say No To Money Bags  
for Abeokuta South and
 Allow Member of di Parti to pick who dem want, and said dem preferred aspirant na Farouk Akintunde
One of di parti leader wey follow lead di protest waka, Balogun Ololade, tok say make Gov dapo Abiodun intervene for di matter to save democracy waka from jeopardy.
Between DSS and pipo wey wan separate for some region
As DSS don put hand for ear for group and pipo dem wey dey tok and do things wey fit provoke and distrupt di ethno-religious environment and threaten harmonous co-existence of di majority common folk of di kontri, don begin dey sound like say na one pesin tok until dem force dem komot for wia dem dey deceive pipo.
Question wey don dey linger about who or which pesin and group di security agent dey follow tok na im dem  promptly vapourized for di heated rhetorical outbust of di nation prominent geo-ethnic agitator dem.
Afenifere, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF)and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF).
E kom clear for all of us eye say dis na di group of pipo wey don kontinu to dey resort to inciting, unguarded and divisive statement and act dem, to take set kontri pipo against demsef to take put fire of tribal and religious discord, as di DSS din charge for one of dem warning.
Interestingly, non for inside di major suspect dem for di exploitation of some fault line dem to take kos ethno-religious violence for some part of di kontri fit categorically distance demsef from di treacherous and subversive activity dem wey security agent detect.
Dem chorus di same conviction say di DSS sabi di pipo wey dey responsible, dem only differ for di direction wey dem dey point dem accusing finger.
AS Afenifere tok say dis pipo sabi di ones wey dey responsible for di acts, but dem no fit touch dem bikos of di connect wey dem get, PANDEV tok am again about plenty pipo wey dey run alienated and ACF dey do like say dem no know, dem dey ask who di pipo be?
Since di DSS know dem and dem satanic waka, make dem take action to take deal with dem.
Di NEF sound like pesin wey no dey convinced with if say pipo dey wey dey push di kontri enter deep crises  and dem know dem, make dem treat dem accordin to di law.
You no need to be spook to know wetin di DSS sabi about dis flag bearers of geo-ethnic politics for Nigeria or to understand why dem all know say DSS sabi dem yet dem insist to pass di buck outside dem clique.
 Di truth be say dis pipo wey dey champion ethnic politics no sabi any better solution to di problem wey Nigeria dey face than make dem sectional enclave and chief dey lord am ova di remainin of di kontri as rulers, not leaders!
Dem dey desperate and unscrupulous to pursue dem inordinate ambition dem dat dem dey agitate absurdly and frequently to take break Nigeria up.
Ambition-powered mind games intoxicate dia geographical consciousness to reduce all it takes to excising di territorial contours of dia enclaves with di frenzied ease of cutting dia portion of di remaining crumbs of di proverbial national cake. 
To put am simple, to break up or out of Nigeria as one ultimate political panacea or consolatory opportunity to achieve inordinate ambition of pipo or group wey dey undermine di ambition of majority wa-zo-bia Nigeria commoner restlessly for enduring peaceful coexistence, e easy to tok pass to do. 
All dis group be major block to di steady attainment of unity and to dey live together in peace wey Nigeria don dey labour for since flag of independence.
For as long as dem kontinu to parade di political terrain as ethnic champions, na for so long wey dem go regard Nigeria as an entitlement for dem ethnic stake for di population, to be claimed or seized, and if all fail, make dem deconstruct am and disown am as state wey don fail.
Whenever dem meet, di agenda no be for say make Nigeria for progress and develop, unless di leadership dey dem hand firmly, odawise na all about hecking and jostling around wit barely concealed determination to deploy di notorious Nigerian Ph.d, pull-him-down syndrome against di incumbent non-indigene President.
Whether na ACF, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEV or Northern Elders Forum, dem existence and activities go dey oppose di quest of Nigeria for unity, peace and development.
Anoda indicment wey we no fit deny for dis regional separatist be say all of dem na sel-styled political pressure groups wey dey pretend like representative of various ethnic groups dem.
From di membership, E dey plain to see dat dey consist of ex-this
Ironically, dis political deficiency give dem di ginger to kom togeda, desperate say make dem remain relevant for democratic system wey elected representative dey run through registered political parti dem wit  legislative and executive institution wey dem establish wit constitution to take dispense good governance and dividends of democracy.
Na only nasty nuisance value wey di geo-ethnic groups dem get for awa democratic setin as dem kontinu with mischief, sabotage, blackmail and subversion wey dem intend to take make Nigeria ungovernable as dem dey threaten and dem dey attempt so dat if dem get chance dem fit regain political relevance plus kontrol.
Na why dem frequesnt meetin don dey cause security alert!
Wit dis kind predator-politician dem wey dem dey waka ariund di perimeter of power wit dubious intent and dem dey undermine goment wey dem elect just bikos say dem no dey involved for di, e dey beyond reasonable doubt say convergence of interest dey wey dey link dem overt activity dem and di covert criminality of kidnappers, insurgents, armed robbers, bandits and allied terrorists, combine to take make Nigeria no dey governable.
Na double danger fit describe di tryin situation of di Buhari administration as dem get to handle such nomba of formidable enemy wey dey unleash plenty assaults on national security for di time wey economy dey face new difficult things. 
To dat extent, only two group of politician fit dey: dos wey dey participate with positive mind for di democratic dispensation wey dem be partner for movin di kontri forward against all odds and dos wey get negative mind wey dey bring discord and disorder to take distabilize di kontri.
By wetin dem dey tok and wetin dem dey do, we all sabi dem!
At di end of di day, di majority fo Naija pipo be ordinary citizen wey dem condition to take survive no dey follow or depend on top wia dem come from.
Dem struggle evri day to make livin dey follow dem submission to di will of one God even as dem faith dey different.
Nigeria na dem fatherland wey destiny don put dem, and dem remain loyal, dem dey follow and dem dey pray, bkos dem know say dem no get any othe kontri to call dem own, togeda dem dey show how citizenship go fit breed true patriotism.
Dem also know say Afenifere,  Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Northern Elders Forum (NEF) and Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) don dey use incitin, unguarded and divisive statements and activities to take put citizen against one anoda say make dem fit put fire for di tribal and religious wahala for di political ambition of dem leaders. 
Di prayer wey remain for poor man mouth na:
GOD DEY,
NIGERIA GO BETTER!

Wetin dem no suppose wear for public: Negatin Nigeria's multiculturalism
By Bashir Ibrahim Hassan
Shey na pure coincidence say, as trouble be dey smell for inside Kwara state recently, dem dey considr solution to am for lower House for inside di National Assembly for di capital territory wey be Abuja? 
DI trouble wey dey for Ilorin na as dem take refuse of some Christian faith school dem to allow dem muslim student to dey wear hijab kom school.
Di solution for this predicament na di debate on top Religious Discrimination (Prohibition, Prevention)
RDPP Bill, 2021, as dem ridicule Hijab Bill for a section of media for Nigeria.
Both event be spark heated argument and often emotional debate wey, at di bottom of evritin, dey threaten to negate multicultural identity and reality of Nigeria.
Di whole idea fpr Kwara of di proprietor of school dem as dem ban Muslim student dem wey dey wear hijab nd dem sympathiser dem fit dey reduced to wetin dem no suppose wear for public.
Dis na anoda major part of di concern of di RDPP Bill before di House of Representative di humiliation and denial of opportunities
Wey female for Nigeria dey face bikos of wetin dem dey wear for public.
E dey clear say di former clearly breach di fundamental human right of di muslim students to take express dem faith without discrimination; even though di school fit get defence or taking dat kind position.
Di latter dey try to assert dis right no be for Muslim dem alone but also for Christians wiaver or whenever dem threaten dem wit discrimination bikos of di fauth wey dem show.
To run through di argument wey proprietor of Christian faith schools inside Kwara, easy for pesin to understand di pragmatic appeal of di argument say make Muslim children go oda school dem fpr oda pleces if dem no wan conform.
Di problem wey die argument get many. 
First, to tok say make Muslim student dem go anoda place unless dem agree to rule of di school on top uniform dey do very little to promote inclusiveness, wey be di bedrock of awa multicultural and multi-religious society.
Secondaly, di position dey ask moral question: shey we fit justify to base rule for school on top di Christian majoritarian of di school?
Then, di third one, di argument o go elsewia appear say e don ignore di difficulty dem wey dey inside changing school for a pikin.
Di inconvenience plenty.
As dem dey change school for pikin dem, pipo wey dey education psychology go tell you say, e dey interfere negatively with not just emotional but academic development too.
Finally, di christian faith school by demselves risk wetin we dey call ghettorization by concentrating students with di same religious belief dem for particular schools.
Di social cost wey dis thing go get for society plebty.
Di Commissioner for Education, Kemi Adeosun, argue, when she dey follow press tok, say di goment dey convinced say dem policy to allow willing Muslim schoolgirls to wear dem hijab for public schools go lead to sustainable peace and communal harmony wey build on top mutual respect and understanding.
For inside kontri wey guarantee freedom of religion, wey sign di declaration of international Human Rights, di basic question to ask na: how justifiable e be to deny child for inside Nigeria access to school of dem choice on top di basis of dem religion?
Na great concern bikos Nigeria na signatory to di Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR).
Di UDHR insists say  all human being dem dey  free and equal, say dem colour, creed or religion no matter.
E contain 30 article dem on top right and freedom wey include, among oda dem, like di rif=ght to life, free speech and privacy.
E include economy, social and cultural rights, like di right to get health and education.
I see article 18 and 26 of UDHR very relevant to di issue wey dey for consideration and we quote dem for full below:
evribodi get di freedom to thingk or believe wetin dem want, including belief wey be religion own.
We get right to change awa belief or religion any time, and di right to practice awa religion for public pr private, alone or with oda pipo.. 
evribodi suppose get right to education.
Primary school suppose dey free.
We suppose fit kontinu awa studies as far as we get di wish.
For school we suppose dem suppose help us develop awa talents, and make dem dey teach us how to respect evrione human right.
Dem also suppose teach us how we go take get on with oda pipo whatever dem ethnicity, religion, or kontri dem kom from.
Our parent get right to choose di kind school wey we go go.
 All dis kind law na dem be di instrument wey give Muslim woman dem like Ilhan Omar di equality to take sit for inside di House of Representative for inside US and she still dey wear Hijab without say dem molest or discriminate am.
Ilhan Abdullahi Omarna America politician wey dey serve for di U.S Representative for 5th congregation for  Minnesota district since 2019.
Na di Deputy Chairman for House of Representative Committee on top Finance matter, wey dey represent Bida/Gbako/Katcha Federal constituency for Niger state be sponsor di bill.
Saidu Musa Abdullahi.
Di bill dey to address discriminatory conduct dem, plus to prohibit  as dem dey discriminate on top religion matter when e concern as dem dey give pipo work and di terms and condition wey dey follow am.
E go stop qualifyin and proffesional joinbodi dem, education institution, pipo wey dey do employment and oda sector dem to dey discriminate against person, student or personnel based on dem religion or di manifestation.
When passed, di law will bury issues such as what we saw in Kwara for good. When dem pass am, di law go bury issue wey be like wetin we see for Kwara patapata.
E go also address di bigot behaviour of executive dem wey dey carry dem prejudice enter public office and dem go still allow am cover dem sense of judgement.
Dem Suppose welkom di law.
After all, na only to expand and expatiate di provision dem wey dey for inside di Nigeria constitution and for UDHR document as we take tok am above.
E follow line with similar law dem wey dem pass for di kontri to take tackle social wahal and cultural practice dem wey dey harmful di law wey dey Prohibit violence against pipo and disability law (VAPP). 
As disability dey try to komot any discrimination wey dey face pipo wey get disability, VAPP dey face domestic plus oda gender violence dem for inside di kontri. 
One by one, pipo wey dey represent us for inside di legislative chamber dem don dey use legal instrument dey  tackle all social wahala  wey dey face awa kontri.
Dem dey address all dis social roughness no be to say law be no dey before wey dey address dem, but dem wan carry evritin togeda make dem for no allow see finish.
As e be like say road still far for UDHR, and instrument to take enforce am neva dey, di RDPP law and oda law dem wey resemble am dey ground to carry punishment give offenders.
As e dey contradict di view of critics, as far as di RDPP Bill dey concerned, no prove dey say dem wan dem wan put state of religion on top any state wey fit domesticate di law.
E no go against Section 10 of di Constitution for Nigeria wey support make Di Goment of do Federation or for State fit no adopt any religion as State Religion.
To push di argument, bikos di bill dey call for general public to dey respect di right of womn dem wey be muslim wey dey wear Hijab for public place, say na to only quench Islamaphobia.
For di final analysis, e dey go against awa multicultural pretenses to dey deny any Nigerian be it male or female dem religios freedom.
E dey against equality, and basic human right as e take dey inside constitution for Nigeria and di legal document for Universal Declaration of Human Rghts.
Bill wey go make dat kind decimation on religion bikom criminal, like di RDPP bill go get welkom nod.
Na from Abuja Bashir dey write.

Di kind of pipo wey we dey put for police dey make me wonder f we want anything wey good to from dis kontri komot.

If you stop pipo say make dem no read hard copy of newspaper, shey you go still stop dem say make dem no read di same tori on top Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Telegram, plus oda pipo?

On di 30th of May, do World Igbo Congress (WIC) hold zoom conversation, wehere dem dey tok about hero wey fall for Biafra.
Why police no go Youtube, Zoom and oda social media wey carry di matter for air?

And di Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Project wey we do afta di goment no fit show bitter result.

We kom dey under pressure say make di road dey ready and make we build di houses too as per Babatunde tok.
Na  seven things go make or destroy Nigeria for 2023. 
Buffeted by deep – seated existence challenge wey di leaders no fit tackle, many people don belief say di future survival of Nigeria no dey sure. 
Di sign don dey certain and clear for di aspect of life; Many people wey dey under di country don dey under di control of non – state  actors , shrinking economy wey result to rising of inflation and poverty and social sector wey don fall yakata. 
But  di one wey dangerous pass na di lack of trust wey dey among our leaders, pipo and all di ethnic groups and di social class of pipo wey make up di kontri.
Di fact say currently Nigeria don dey go toward a delicate moment of hin existence as a kontri wey no fit bi denied. 
To dey sure, no kontri wey dem no face challenges from di start.
But di different wey dey between success and failure na di leaders wey no sabi manage di challenges and di way dem dey cope wit issues of di nation.
As he dey go, as we dey look di soso deteriorate wahala including di mata of our life all failure of our leaders of all levels of situations make dem take better hand hold di mata  wey dey face the kontri make he better.
Soso many Nigerians dey doubt say di future of di kontri fit no bitter again. 
Di thought of di people bi say di election wey go take place for 2023 go get plenty palava pass the ones wey we don get before.
Dey notice say di problem wey we see na him dey get solution, I don gather seven problems wey dey cause wahala wey need quick attention to solve and failing to solve doz problem fit make di kontri fall apart.
Di Fulani problem na him bi di number one koko wey of di matter wey dey cause kasala wey we gat take eye look into. 
Di soso fight we don dey hear about di Fulani herders and di farmers in kontri dey cause contradictory and hatred between normal pipo and di aimless families of di Fulani’s.
We gat put mouth for di position wey Fulani hold in di histrorical, political and social evolution of  Nigeria. 
We fit describe Nigeria as country of joint legacy of nineteenth century Fulani Jihadist Sheilk Usman dan Foldio and Sir Frederick Lugard wey bi di architect of amalgamation and di first British colonial Governor-General of Nigeria
Sheilk dan Fodio 
na di first person wey establish Fulani dominance for an area wey get di size of two – third of di Northern Nigeria for di Fulani’s wey lead di Jihad of 1804
Na for di political and social structure of dis dan Fodio creation wey di Britons build dia colonial enterprise for Nigeria, a legacy wey subsists to a large extent to dis day.
As a group, di Fulani wey bi single most powerful and influential factors for Nigeria politics.
Na dem dey control one half of di traditional/spiritual realm through di Islamic religion as well as di temporal turf of Nigeria politics and governance. 
Di Fulani don arrange dis special advantage in di struggle for di control of di soul of Nigeria politics opens dem to accusation wit some reason wey dey one use to control forever for political power in di kontri to comot and damage other ethnic groups
Now who kom put dat thing for they?
I dey so heavy Ladena and to say i go see dis kind for here!
Dis place nah d place wey people wey get plenty face-value dey reason than I despair and dis fact no make me dey balance.
I kon realize wetin dey before me. 
I fit fly and run away with oda people sweat.
I fit surrender fighting and my life go kon dey comfortable. 
But nah here I dey and I con see say I no fit stand alone. 
Shey make I stand alone
I fit fly, live and die. 
But na, here before me, on my ancestors land di aspect of not wanting to die.
Here I fit live life wey go full of event and so so enjoyment, of building and breaking to record and d barriers wey pesin neva break anywhere and to dey live to defeat hopelessness.  
Where people fit defeat hopelessness expect in d heart of darkness?
Maybe I go die while trying, but how man go die better wen he dey face challenges wey dey fear pesin like d one wey I dey face? 
We no need to build skyscrapers, d station for nuclear power or maglev trains, Nah we go build d next best thing. Maybe Conrad fit want a piece of doz things.
He don reach his highest satisfactions but we dey ten percent.
We fit rise and rise sote Lambs go turn to Lions and by dat time d sun go dey shine on my generation, I go kon bikom a fulfilled man
I go endure di  whole thing and maybe I fit see something chop from ham. 
If no be so, I go still be a fulfilled man even if I dey on my death bed oneday. 
Nothing sweet pass d happiness and joy wey person dey feel on deathbed. 
Nah him make me bring out new terms of my surrender.
We go dey fight dey go.

wit small days to di start of Ramadan fast for di Islamic lunar year of 1442AH, e no be news again say di holy month don dey near.
Na for dis sacred month wey di holy Quran get revealed to Prophet Muhammad (Salla-llahu Alayhi Wa Sallam, SAW) for di guidance of humanity.
For inside di month of Ramadan be one night wey dey better than thousands of month.
Bikos say Ramadan be one unique spiritual season, e dey important to effectively prepare hawasef for am so dat evri opportunity wey dey Ramadan dey optimally utilized; make we no take anything wit sipini hand.
Ramadan be di month wey Musllims always dey hapi to look up to.
Im be month wey no get contender.
Im be holy month wey Allah (SWT) promise say hin go forgive evri Muslim wey don repent; give mercy to evri seeker of clemency; and hin go forgive dos wey ask for forgiveness.
Make person dey prepare for Ramadan require make we know wen to dey watch out for di cresent of di Islamic lunar month of Ramadan.
By di current count of di month of Shaban on di Timing Chapter calendar, to dey look for di cresent is expected to start for Monday April 12, 2021 wey dey equivalent to 29th day of Shaban.
Abu Hurayrah (RA) report say di Prophet (SAW) di gates to hell fire go dey close for evri Ramadan period just like how di gates to paradise go dey open durin the same period make di wish and prayer of dos wey like paradise get answerd.
For place wey di cresent of Ramadan no dey sighted on the 29th day of Shaaban, di month go count say im don complete im circle of 30th day where Ramadan fast automatically start di next day, wey go be 1st of Ramadan.
We no suppose begin Ramadan fast until we hear say dem don see di cresent from correct sources.
For Naija, di tradition be say Muslims go wait for di announcement say dem don see cresent from His Eminence di Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Saad Abubakar.
Allah (SWT) tok for Quran 4:59 say
All of una wey believe!
Obey Allah, obey di Messenger, and dos wey dey places of authority among una.
Di more we dey kampe and we dey patient and wait and obey Sultan tok, di more united and strong we go dey as Muslim community.
We advise pipu wey dey part of di Muslim community to dey wary of unsubstantiated pieces of information wey fit show face for social media on wen Ramadan go start.
We advise di general public make dem stay away from news wey dem no sabi who tok am wy dey tok about seeing di moon.
Information wey no correct fit throw Muslim communities inside confusion.
Remember say Allah wrath dey wait for rumour mongers.
Di teaching of di Prophet Muhammed (SAW) discourage di observance of voluntary fast wey dey close to di start of Ramadan fast.
Dis na to avoid situation where voluntary fast, wey be prophetic injunction, is seen to dey part of Ramadan fast; di latter wey be obligatory act of worship sanctioned by Allah (SWT)
For dos wey dey observe di voluntary fast evri Monday, e dey advise make dem skip Monday next week bikos of di closeness to Ramadan; bikos e be 29th day of Shaaban.
As part of delibrate preparation for Ramadan and make we see chance take advantage of the spiritual benefits of Ramadan, e dey important make we review awa daily routines to create plenty time for engaging in devolutional activities.
Dis go allow us have more time to take recite di Glorious Quran (for dos wey no get am as routine) or more time to dey recite and understand the Quran.
Make we decide quick quick to observe Tarawih prayers in consultations wit individuals wey traditionally make up di prayer congregation for di family level or conventionally for public mosque.
Make we also define di kain task wey we dey engage during the day for Ramadan period, make we no miss out from observing Tarawih prayers afta we break fast or Tahajjud prayers afta midnight.
For us to preserve di sancuary of awa Ramadan fast, need dey to review awa usual interaction wit ICT platforms especially di social media.
The goment don ban Twitter
Im dey important to indentify and avoid some kain websites, television channels and radio programmes wey fit bring negative impact on awa Ramadan fast
Make we dey prepare to also avoid some kain toks for awa respective work place, make e prevent us for toking and hearing some bad toks.
Dem advise Muslim scholars, preachers, prayer leaders, presenters and anchors of radio and television programmes to avoid di use of provocative and discourteous expressions durin preaching sessions.
Dem suppose exhibit good sense of maturity as dem dey educate dia audience on how dem dey teach Islam
Wisdom and good tok, do yeye or insult, be central to effective and popular religious proselyzation.
Di kontri still dey struggle to overkom plenty wahala, e dey wise for Muslim clerics to abstain from sandwiching dia religion preaching wit politica and ethnic sentiment.
We advise dealers and retailers of consumer goods make dem no do yeye inflation of market price bikos of Ramadan season.
E dey wicked for any trader to dey see Ramadan as opportunity to dey skyrocket food price bikos demand of food plenty, especially sugar and fruits durin Ramadan
Make we dey fear God for evrithing wey we dey do and say to make moni.
We encourage philanthropic individuals, groups and NGOs to dey organise or support public breaking of Ramadan fast, at least for less priviledge Muslims.
Na time be dis for Ramadan for evri Muslim to extend hand of friendship, charity, and kindness to dia fellow muslims.
May Allah guide us to start and end di Ramadan fast in peace and wit ease. Amin.

Afta we don look dis well well for Tottenham, I fit tell you say e no dey true.
Mourinho no take training bikos say e don sabi say hin time for Spurs don kom to an end
Di training session apun but hin no attend
Daniel Levy wey be Chief Executive arrive eaarly and e summon Mourinho to hin office wey dey training facility
Na dia he give Mourinho di news say dey don sack am
Daniel Levy wey be Managing Director no dey hapi wit Mourinho criticising plenty players afta dem no too do well for pitch
Di players dey angry ay Mourinho no dey support dem and for dressing room, things no dey go well.
Dem sack am for Chealsea, sack am for Manchester United and now Tottnham don sack am bikos say e turn on hin players and e no wan take blame for di bad results wey dem get.
Again, dey don prove di point say id players no dey hapi, managers must go.
Dem send di players text message say Mourunho no dey in charge again
Levy sef dey vex say mourinho don spend seventeen months for White Hart Lane and hin no produce team wey better pass wetin Mauricio Pochettino build.
Levy dey vex say players wey get quality like Gareth Bale and Dele Alli dey sit for bench as odas sef dey stuggle to get good result.
Di big kasala be say Mourinho don fail to deliver European Champions League football for next season.
Na di three reasons why Jose dey go back to Portugal wit hin family.

E don respond wit plenty man of the match performance
Unityed manager, Ole Gunner Solskjaer don tok say e go like Jesse kum back but no fir guarantee am a permanent first team place
Dem don tell me say United do set fee of £21.5million.
West Ham don pay £3million loan fee dis season which mean say dem go pay £24.5million. Wey dey more than wetin media outlets don report.

And in Edinson Cavani e dey learn from one of di best.
I no wan see Mount play wit hin back to di goal
Despite all diz good tok, I don learn say Solskjaer go play Mason out wide for di foreseeable future and believe e go move inside during di next couple of years.

Reason why wheat still dey cost.
For uncountable years, di tori of wheat for Nigeria dey dey well even as federal goment and task force take tok say take add join wheat wey dem dey produce.  
Di shallenge now don force many farmers wey dey plant wheat carry dia power go dey plant rice wey dey enjoy funding and policies wey sweat body. 
Wheat wey dem dey demand for we domot don rish over 6 million tonnes (MTs) as we take dey plenty more more wey dem estimate say na over 200 million.
For example, di demand of pipo wey dey do flour dey na like 5.1 MTs while odas wey still dey use am dey use about 1m MTs.
Di rice wey dem dey produce now as Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN) take estimate am na 420,000 MTs, and e go climb rish 600,000 MTs wen dem start to dey plug rice next two months. 
Few month ago, di price of wheat rish N32,000 for one 100kg bag wey force flour and wetin dem dey carry am do like bread put money.
As dem take dey produce wheat dey waka slow because e get one wahala wey dey am drag am since 2018.
ABP not role.
Since 2018, farmer wey dem plant wheat, dem nor enjoy wetin Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) dey give dem again
Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP) after dem enjoy about N2.3 billion dat year.
This year about 285,000 farmers na im CBN done put hand but di moni palava wey show face as dem dey recover moni wey dem borrow for 2018, wey be about 40 percent, nor help mata.
The President of WFAN, Alhaji Salim Mohammed Sale, tell Daily Trust say dem no gree put dem for ABP even as dem get about 285,000 farmers wey dem don put hand and dey qualify. 
Alhaji Sale tok say as dem take dey recover take dey poor, first participating financial institution witidrewcomeot hand for mata and CBN nor gree make dem shange to anoda bank. 
Na di same hapun for 2019 wia dem don put hand for 11,000 farmers but dem not fit kolet di fund bicos of di recover of 2018. 
Alhaji Sale still tok say, dis year dem engage 285,000 farmer dem and CBN don put hand for di list.
Afta we follow Unity Bank talk, dem say dem nor wan follow us work, we kom waka go Keystone Bank.
Afta we don meet evri requirement, Keystone write letter to kolet moni for di programme, but some kain palava dey because e get one gbese wey we nor get moni pay for. 
So dem say make we waka go Unity Bank wia we get di gbese.
We draw out like three or four point say make dem continue di programme wit us so dat one; We go fit produce wheat wella; two, nor be di farmer wey march law dey go di programme so e go teach dem lesson and go make dem pay backcome join again; three, we go don learn from wetin don happun and we go bring something wey beta to take dey recover; four, to bring katapila wey go make di programme get head. 
He tok di best way nor be to stop di programme patapata but to luk as dom fit take improve recovery, e add say nor be all farmer wey dey plant rice, maize and cotton pay all their gbese but programme still continue for dem. 
E tok say dis go affect to dy produce wheat, tok say, as di ABP take dey, plenti farmer no go still wan go into production
Alhaji Sale tok say,na di joinbodi dey give farmers mind go plant becos of di agreement wey dem get wit pipo wey dey buy.  
You nor fit plant somtin wey u nor go fit sell.
We try make market dey between we anddimillers. 
Even each persin deycome tru di joinbodicome sell dia market to milling plants and dem dey find am easy.
Now we di programme nor dey, di farmer dey find am hard to sell their market inside di market. 
Two, E norish don dey for subsector of wheat.
Di only way wey you fit take cut import moni wey we dey pay down na to tok to plenty farmer make dem produce.

Pipo wey don tok on top di mata don tok say hope nor dey.
To tok di wan wey small, e don shoke as persin, Nigeria pipo don dey doubt if we fit survive am and live togeda again as area wey get peace. 
Big big pipo inside di kontri n aim e be like say dem doncomeot mind wey make dem tok say di only way wey tocomet dia palava na for federal goment to find foreign assistance to fit tackle security kasala.
Di opposition political parti inside di contri, PDP, join mouth put dey tell All Progressives Congress,APC we dey led say Nigeria need outside help to fit tackle security kasala wey don dis.
As e dey tok im own, di president  of senate wey just pass, Bukola Saraki say president  Muhammadu Buhari don dey taya ontop di security kasala, he de tanda say federal goment need sharpsharp help and make dem find am wit out nor waste time.
He also advise  di president  say make ekari all beforebefore president  and heads of state, beforebefore and nownow chief justices, serving and oga dem for National Assembly, beforebefore and nownow oga dem for security agencies, traditional rulers dem wey get experience wey good, oga for private sector dem, development partners, friends of Nigeria for internationalcomemunity wit odas wey fit find solution for dimata wey dey ground.

Di National Leader of di All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, say Nigeria need joinhand to tackle di security shallenge,dey tok say evri contri go pass tru hard time and we must dey united to take succeed.
He had put say nor president  wan make kontri dey inside palava, e note say na only join hand response fit end dis plenty security kasala.
Di best way na wetin we dey do. Tocome togeda take reduce banditry, to move for unity and fit to  bring a beta Nigeria give pipo.
The welfare of awa  pipo dey very important.
And yes, everi contri go pass di hard and difficult time.
How we take dey tell am to pipo, na which area to take make am easy for pipo; na dem dat area on top how to fit change di leader for di contri; na im he tok.
The truth be say, mata neva spoil too spoil as many stakeholders take dey show am.
Hope neva lost finish.
Di one nor be say dem nor dey right for wetin dem see and wetin dem tok.
We fit savage dimata wit colabo wit all stakeholders especiallyditraditional rulers dem, religious leaders,joinjoin among security pipo and for federal goment to fit provide solution of tribe abi political interest.
Time doncome again wey be saydiwork of tradional ruler to make peace must dey recognized for every corner.
Na dem get culture of di pipo fo hand and dia religion to one place.
Traditional rulers becos of say dem dey close to di pipo, fit do big tin to take solve di security gbege if dem gather and follow dem tok wella from local goment go statecomerish federal.
If dem follow traditional ruler dem for every angle for di state yarn wella, dem fit be di koko of wia  secutity pipo go dey get information as to take know criminal tin wey dey dia area because dem sabi dem wey dey di area
E dey needed for security agencies to work together as to take fight insecurity for di land.

The bad mata hapun for Maiduguri some days ago as fighting jet we be dem Nigeria Airforce own take bomb Nigeria Soldiers wey dem go double cross boko haram na mata we open say beta information and coordination between two agencies nor dey.
All di agencies wey be koko for war mata must dey gather tori and spread am to dia sef to take sabi wen, wia  and how enimies wan tackle wit di tori, dia plan go scatter and dem nor go fit attack not to tok of say dem go attack.
Religious leaders tru dia various organisations like Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs, SCIA, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, and others must dey follow and eye open ontop wetin dem go preach give dia pipo and how to take follow follow dia ways. 
Dis men of God dem dey dey respect by dia piporish level say anything wey dem tok dem dey swallow go down whether di word go cause gbege or e nor go cause gbege.
Make dem mobilise dem well and sensitise dem on top danger wey dey for wrong preaching wey fit make one religion pipo dey fight di other.
Examples deon dey wey be say wen palava start from place wey dem dey worship becos of wetin leaders dem tell dia pipo say make dem do, whether to fight back because of one injustice or  anoda one.
Witi beta training, dat kai tin nor go hapun becos dem go don train dem ontop wetin dem go preach and wetin dem nor go preach for dia pipo.
E dey koko to tok am here say all dis nor gocome for vain if goment for every level nor bring wey for peace to dey.
Goment for every level must provide beta beta tins wey youths go dey do to takecomeot their mind from crime.
As to dey try solve security yawa, goment sef suppose see say dem nor do partial ontop tribe, religion or politics as dem dey try solve security kasala.
Pipo wey do crime must dey treat disame disame as di law of di land we im dey take be.
Example of treating some criminals wit small hand na di arrest of some pipo wey dey do Bureau De Change for Kano wey dem say dem dey sponsor Boko Haram gbege.
Till now, how dem be never dey open, wey dey get bad way ontop to fight crime.
Goment must see say dem dey always get in touch wit pipo especially for di downdown for dem to sabi wetin bin dey hapun in di contri in oda not to gree for rumour to get power.  
Witi dis one, Nigeria go fit bit di security kasala wey dey fight am for over 10 years wit easy.

Poultry feed crisis: Why we need more intervention.
Di crisis wey dey di poultry feed industry pass be careful late last year wen many poultry farmers begin dey close down dia farms, sake of say price of feed don high, and dis don make dia cost of operation too much.
Di leadership of di Poultry Association of Nigeria, di association wey all di poultry farmers for di kontri dey under, do emergency meeting for Abuja, to warn say if dem no do sometin kia-kia, di poultry industry fit die.
Di director-general of di association, Onallo S. Akpa, wen e dey call for immediate intervention by di federal government, tok say maize wey be N80,000 per ton and soybeans wey be N120,000 per ton for January 2020, don be N200,000 per ton (maize) and N250,000 per ton
(soybeans) for January 2021.
Clearly, as a way to prevent crisis for di feed distribution industry, di Central Bank of Nigeria put bodi quickly, as dem don agree to release about 300,000 metric ton of maize to di industry batch by batch.
Dis intervention, wey di stakeholders believe say e dey on time, be like say e don reduce di earlier tension wey dey di sector.

Last month, about 50,000MT na im dem give stakeholders for di feed milling industry, and dem go release di remaining small time.
Stakeholders believe say quick release of di remaining tonnes go solve more of di feed challenges wey dey di sector befor di Easter celebration wey dey come.
Di current intervention na join-bodi between di CBN and partners like AFEX Commodities Exchange Ltd, wey dey kontrol di release of di grains.
Di reduction for maize production don be one of di major challenges for agricultural sector, becos as di PAN DG tok, dis na di food wey dem dey chop pass for northern Nigeria.
Dis na di reason why many feed producers wit oda stakeholders dey ask for more support from di CBN in di area of maize and soybeans production.
Di General Manager of Premier Feeds Ltd, Austin Daylop, wey be one of di beneficiary of di intervention, tok say as di new farming season for maize and soybean dey kom, we go need take quick action to meet di demand of di growing population, and also ensure say e no scarce for Nigeria. 
Di Anchor Borrowers Programme wey CBN join bodi with di Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) do na one of dat solution.
We go need establish dat kind programme for maize and soybean production too.
E go surely help us reduce rural-urban migration of di farmers wey insecurity cause, especially for di Northern states wia dem dey plant maize and soybeans.

Iheanacho and Ndidi win FA Cup as Leicester City beat Chelsea for final
Two nigerians, Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi don be FA Cup winners afta dem help Leicester City beat Chelsea 1-0 for di FA Cup final wey dem play on Saturday.
Na Leicester City
first ever FA Cup for di club 137-year old history.
Youri Tieleman amazing strike for di front of 22,000 fans for Wembley na im be di difference between di two teams.
Di largest sport event crowd for England since wey di coronavirus pandemic start 14 months ago enjoy a goal wey fit to win any trophy as di Belgian midfielder shoot inside di top corner for 63 minutes.
Kasper Schmeichel show one amazing save wey deny Mason Mount a goal, and Chelsea sef get one goal wey VAR cancel as offside.
Five years afta Foxes shock di Premier League giants to become champions, Leicester don finally claim di English football oda prestigious trophy di fifth time since dem don dey try.
Dem don lose di final four times, but di last one wey dem lose na 52 years ago.
Di historic week fit even get beta for Brendan Rodgers players, as dem dey close to qualifying for next Champions League season.
Di sides go meet again in three days time for Stamford Bridge to decide who go secure di top-four finish for di Premier League.
Chelsea go need a quick comeback afta dem lose for di fourth time in 27 games since Thomas Tuchel replace Frank Lampard wey dem sack for January.
Di Blues also get Champions League final wey dem dey prepare for against Manchester City in two weeks time, but dem fit end di campaign witout trophy or place for Europe premier club competition next season.
Chelsea success under Tuchel don kom, sake of dia beta defensive record, but dia struggle for  di oda end don show again.
Tuchel men dominate befor first-half but dem struggle to create straightforward chances even afta Leicester defensive lynchpin Jonny Evans carry injury for di middle of di first half.
Wayward Werner Timo Werner
wayward finishing has characterised his first season in England since joining from RB Leipzig for Â£47 million ($66 million) and the German international had another day to forget in front of goal.
Tuchel turned away in disgust after Werner blazed high and wide from the edge of the box with the Leicester defence stretched midway through the first half.
Werner then came closest to breaking the deadlock before half-time as his header drifted just wide and evaded Cesar Azpilicueta as the Chelsea captain launched himself in at the far post.
The welcome return of noise echoing down from 6,000 fans of each side from both ends of the ground helped mask a general lack of quality on the field.
Another 10,000 local supporters, key workers and Football Association stakeholders were also in attendance as Wembley gears up for hosting matches at Euro 2020 next month at 25 percent capacity.
One moment of magic proved decisive as Tielemans collected possession midway inside the Chelsea half and strode forward before unleashing an unstoppable strike into the top corner past Kepa Arrizabalaga.
Tuchel flexed the strength in depth of his squad in an attempt to find an equaliser as Callum Hudson-Odoi, Ben Chilwell, Kai Havertz, Olivier Giroud and Christian Pulisic were all introduced off the bench.
But they were denied by the brilliance of Schmeichel in the Leicester goal.
Chilwell, whose every touch was booed by the Leicester supporters, nearly came back to haunt his old club as his header was turned onto the post by the Dane.
Mount then could not believe his luck as his sweetly struck shot was turned behind by a brilliant stop from Schmeichel.
Even when the Leicester keeper was beaten, Chelsea were denied by a VAR review.
A Wes Morgan own goal looked set to send the game to extra-time, but Chilwell had strayed offside in the build-up.
Leicester players and fans celebrate di decision like a goal and were in raptures again moments later after seeing out a nervy finale.

A guide to soya bean farming as planting go begin by June
Soya na plant wey dem dey grow, mostly becos of e beans wey dem fit use do different tins.
Na legume wey get high nutritious value.
Awa agric editor wey don dey monitor di soya bean value-chain tok say, even say dem know Nigeria as di largest producer of soya for Afrika, di production level still neva reach im full capacity.
Dis na becos most of dose wey dey plant soya bean for di kontri be small farmers. Dem no dey plant am as di main crop, but dem dey use am support oda major crops like corn, cowpea (beans) and cassava.
Som soya bean farmers wey follow Daily Trust yarn believe say wit small agricultural tools and effort, we fit grow di crop for many states for Nigeria.
Di reason why more farmers suppose enta soya bean farming
Mallam Yinusa Jimoh, wey be Ilorin-based retired agric extension officer, tell Daily Trust for fone say apart from di domestic and economical values wey soya bean get, e dey also improve soil fertility and dem fit use am kontrol striga.
E tok say di market for soya bean dey grow fast for Nigeria, and opportunity dey for farmers to improve dia income.
One handbook wey di International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) produce on soya bean show say di fast growth for poultry sector during di past five years don also increase di demand for soya bean meal for Nigeria.
The IITA handbook reads in part: It is also a prime source of vegetable oil in the international market.
Soya bean get average protein content of 40 percent and e get more protein pass any of di common vegetable or animal food source wey dey for Nigeria.
Accordin to IITA, SALMA Oil Mills for Kano, Grand Cereals for Jos, ECWA Feeds for Jos, AFCOT Oil Seed Processors for Adamawa and PS Mandrides wey dey Kano dey all process soya bean.
Wetin dis one mean be say ready market dey for farmers wey get interest for soya farming for di kontri.
Right now, for di local market, one de-rica of soya bean na N600; dependin on di area, while dem dey sell 50kg bag for around N17,000.
Di global demand for di crop na about 11 million tonnes, while di yearly amount of soya bean wey dem dey chop for Afrika na about 619 thousand tonnes.
Di best way wey we fit take use farm soya bean
Accordin to a long time soya bean farmer, Dr Awoniyi Joseph, soya bean planting dey always start for June, and e dey grow well on all type of soil, except deep soil wey no fit hold water.
Dr Joseph yarn farmers say one important tin to consider wen pesin wan start soya bean farming for Nigeria na rainfall.
E tok say Nigeria get very gud climate wey dey perfect for soya bean to flourish.
As Awoniyi tok, gud harvest depend mostly on regular irrigation, becosthroughirrigation, di crop fit grow for areas wey no get plenti rainfall.
Accordin to IITA, make dem no plant soya bean for sandy, gravelly, or shallow soils to prevent drought stress, dem advise say make dem no plant am for soil wey get plenty water or soil wit surfaces wey fit break, cos dis no go make di seed komot well. 
Clear all di plants wey dey, befor u prepare di land.
U fit prepare di seedbed manually wit a hoe or animal-drawn equipment or tractor, IITA advise.
Land wey dem prepare well dey allow di seed germinate well, and e dey reduce weed infestation.
IITA add am join say; U fit plant on ridges or on flat seedbed.
Experts don warn say to choose di type of soya bean wey u go plant, u need look at di period wey e dey take mature, di yield potential, lodging, and how well e fit tolerate drought and resist pest and disease.
John Stephen, wey be soya bean farmer for Garam, one community for Niger State, close to di FCT, insist say na di maturity period u need to consida first wen u wan choose di type of soya bean wey fit ur location.
Stephen advise say, for areas wey get low rainfall, make u consida di seed wey dey mature early rada dan di one wey dey mature late.
Although seed wey dey mature late dey always get beta yield, but e dey risky to plant late maturing seed for dry environments becos of late season drought.
IITA advise farmers say make di type of seed wey dem go choose be of high quality becos soya bean seeds dey quick lose dia viability.
According to di institute, e dey common for soya bean not to grow afta 12 to 15 monts wey e don dey for storage, even wen dem keep am well.
So, make u use seed wey never pass 12 monts so e go fit germinate well.
Select di gud seed komot for planting so u go fit make sure say dem no get insect, disease, or weed seeds.
Make u no buy seed from open market, cos di ability for di seed to germinate no guarantee.
Planting seed wey get poor quality no go produce beta yield.
Di institute advise for di handbook.
Conducting germination test 
If e dey possible, IITA recommend say make u test di seed befor planting.
Di institute recommend say make di germination rate be 85 percent or more to get gud stand.
Accordin to IITA, to conduct a quick seed germination test, make u select 400 seeds randomly, den plant 100 seeds each for four woodin or plastik boxes or seedbed wey u don prepare.
Plant one seed per hole wit a distance of 10cm between di seeds.
Soak di woodin or plastik boxes or di seedbed well wit water befor planting and make u dey put water evri mornin and evenin.
Begin dey count di seedlings five days afta planting and complete di counting within 10 days.
If u fit count a total of 320 seeds wey germinate, e mean say di germination rate of di seed na 80 percent and above.
Wen di percentage of germination na 80 percent or less, u go need increase di seed rate to achieve 100 percent.
Fertiliser application
IITA advise say to recommend beta fertiliser for soya bean production, pesin go need to do a gud soil test.
For normal kondition, soya bean as legume wey e be suppose provide esef wit nitrogenthroughbiological nitrogen fixation.
Until nodulation don happun, di soya bean plant go dey depend on di soil nitrogen to grow.
Phosphorus na im di plant dey lack pass, derefor, make u put di best phosphorous fertiliser so e go fit grow well.
Di institute still advise farmers say make dem put di fertiliser inside di soil wen dem dey harrow and level di farm.
Pests, diseases and weeds
Na problem Perennial and most annual weeds be to soya bean wen e jus dey grow
Gud weed kontrol programme for di proper time fit reduce di effect of weed.
Weed kontrol for soya bean fit be manual or chemical, or both.
Manual weed kontrol
: Make u do di first weedin two weeks afta plantin and di second one, five to six weeks afta plantin.
Make u no weed di farm immediately rain fall, becos dis go make di weed grow for anoda place.
bad weedin or delay fit make di yield reduce badly.
Chemical weed kontrol:
Herbicides na safe and effective way to kontrol weed for soya bean farming, if we use am wella.
Di kind herbicide wey u go use kom depend on di kind weed wey dey dere and if di herbicide dey available.
Herbicides dey available for pre-emergence or post-emergence weed kontrol for soya bean.
If u use herbicide durin plantin, u go need weed di farm five to six weeks afta plantin.
Na different insects dey affect soya bean farm, but na only few of dis insects no get any economic importance, and dose ones wey fit damage crops no dey plenty reach di amount wey go need kontrol measures.
Durin di vegetative stage, di crop dey immune to caterpillars but e dey very weak to silverleaf whitefly attack.
Harvest
Soya bean dey ready to harvest for shelling and fresh use from 65 days afta planting.
Howeva, dry soya beans need 100 or more days befor u fit harvest am.
Soya bean farmers don advise say for beans wey get green shell, u fit harvest am wen di pods dey green, full and plump.

Make we add to diz, di million ton of grass wey dey fallow land and open range
To access diz fodder dem, wey dey always dey available only for situ, cattle go move and dem go dey openly gaze
for many case, dem go pay farmer and take permission before dem do am
Na diz touchlight why kilo of beef dey sell for N1700
Until di kontri get ways wey dem fit process di fodder dem, banning open grazing no fit apun
But I know say some wayo pipo wey dey among herder dem dey engage for criminal things and justice system no see dem prosecute
Na small scale livestock producer dem wey settle for different different community wey dey Nigeria
Dem go negotiate wit pipo wey get di community t buy land wey dem go build, grow dia crop and keep dia cattle
She tok say di center don agree and stand gidigba for INEC for di review and realignment of some of im department make im dey very very capable to fit produce result and efficient for  di management of im human resources and assets.
dem don add 6 NIPP plant dem, 22 new substation for di power grid wey dey 6 years report.
Generation companies (GenCos) and 22 power substation wey dem build and dey operate between 2015 and now, don make improvement dey for di national eletcricity grid to di 5,800 megourtt wey be di highest peak energy wey dem record for March 2021.
Dis dey according to di latest NIPP report on top power project execution since 2015, wey Daily trust obtained from di Niger Delta power holding company (NDPHC).
Di NIPP na di intervention vehicle warehouse wey di federal, state and local goment own for NDPHC.
For 2015, di power grid don dey between 4,500 megourtts (MW) wey don bikom useful by di commissioning and utilisation of Geregu, Omotosho, Olorunshogo, Alaoji, calabar, Ihovbor NIPP GesCos
Dat one add nearly 1,000MW
Howeva, di grid continue to dey rise wit all-time peak electricity wey don reach 5,801.60MW as of March 2021, according to di statistics wey we get from independent system operation (ISO) arm of di Transmission company of Nigeria. (TCN)
NDPHC don start di NIPP intervention wit di first phase wey dey power generation.
E don begin dey build 10 power GenCos wey dem dey call ' The Big Ten' around gas-producing state dem wey include Ondo, Ogun, and Kogi states.
Howeva, work still dey go on dem till 2015
Dem lunch the second phase for 2015 to include intervention project, wey go focus on transmission, distribution, and energy wey dem don renew towards meeting NDPHC mandate for lighting di nation.
currently, dem bin dey six power GenCos wey dey produce about 3,400MW electricity for di national grid while di four oda GenCos dey ongoing.
Even among di four, some of im turbines don dey commission and dey operational since 2015.
Explanation of di report show say di NIPP intervention for di transmission section wey dey di power sector value di chain, NDPHC don complete 22 substations wey bin dey compromise 10 units of 330/132 kilovolts (KV) level and 12 units of 132/33KV  substations.
E don also complete 2,194 kilometres wey dey 330KV power transmission line and 887km wey dey 132KV transmission lines.
Dis infracstructure since 2015, don add  5,590MVA energy supply capacity wey dey 330KV level and 3,793MVA wey dey 132KV level.
To promote energy wey dey clean and improve, di NIPP for di second phase don turn to major driver of di federal goment energy mix by 2030 wey dem dey call vision 30-30-30 wich seek energy wey go improve to at least 30 percent of di energy grid by 2030.
While e don install 20,000 solar home systems for some northen states, di NIPP don dey deliver a huge part of the ongoing five million SHS to domot nationwide under di Economic Sustainability plan (ESP).
Dia bin dey intervention for di gas sector wey go solve major challenge of di power plant wich be di availability of gas-to-power.
According to di oga patapata for NDPHC, Mr Chiedu Ugbo, for interview wey im get with Daily Trust,di company dey achieve dis tru di fuel and gas or public private partnership model.
E don create a department for dis to spearhead im gas pipeline and feed stock wey dey connect all di 10 NIPP GenCon.
wen dem tok power distribution, di report tok say di NIPP intervention bin don see di completion of ovr 360 NIPP injection substations wit a combined capacity wey reach 3,540 MW.
To complement dis substations, NDPHC don build about 2,600KM of 11KV power distribution lines and 4600KM of 33KM distribution lines wey dey supply electricity directly to transformer
Dia bin dey 296 appointed project wey dem don distribute, wich injection substations dey inside, 1924 of 33kv lines, 4600km of 11kv lines wit dem oda infastruction 
NDPHC sef don increase im distribution capacity wit di installation of 25,900 completely self-protected (CSP)  transformer wey dey across obodo, nah Mr Ugbo add dis one. 
On top all dis achivement wey don help to improve di operation of national grid, di report highlight threat to di infastructure especially for di one wey dey di power distribution level.
Some of di wahala wey NDPHC dey see for dis distribution be say dem dey tif dia equipment and infrastructure, vandalism, and lack of cooperation from Distribution companies (DisCos
Di oda nah community wahala wey dey regard land and Right of way ( ROIs), motor accident wey don damage some power infrastructure and rising insecurity wey dey facility areas, e start
for a comment wey go empty di property of di NIPP intervention to Nigerian wey dey comsume electricity, di President for di Nigeria consumer Protection Network ( NCPN), Barrister Kunle Kola Olubiyo, im tok say di reason for di power sector privatatization exercise wey dem conclude for November 2013 hapen to promote competitive economy and inclusive growth by 
Im howeva tok say despite dis, di sector neva reach dat kin viability, so di goment need to deepen di interventions tru NIPP.
On top all di tremendous milestone wey NIPP/NDPHC don achieve, dia bin major area of impediment wey dey full realizeation of di lofty idea wey di management of NDPHC championed.
Mr Olubiyo tok say di wahala dem dey face include delay in taking over projects by di DisCos wich dem suppose capture for dia capital Expenditure ( CAPEX)
Im continue im tok say nah di Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) bin di inderance for di delay in di implementaion of di regulations of eligeable consumer
wit di kin huge power assets wey NIPP don provide, di Manufacturers Association of Nigeria ( MAN) and oda dedicated power users fit decide to connect to di NIPP plants and facilities directly and dey enjoy uninterrupted power supply, but dis bin dey delay.
Anoda wahala wey NDPHC dey get nah funding, wich im think say di equity stakeholders suppose raise for more power sector projects.
Di leadearship of di power sector go need to address di low tariff wey dey NIPP plants and di low load (Energy) dispatch wey dey available units from TCN
Consumer dem dey look for more electricity, why energy from NIPP GenCos con dey restricted ?
Nah so Olubiyo ask.
unlike oda places, Ramadan season for Nigeria don unfortunately turn into a season wey dey get unnecessary controversy
Di controvercy don start from di arrival of di Ramadan crescent wey dey usher in di new month and di moon go waka commot to show e end. 
di Ramadan peroid dey equally witness controversy ova ideological, jurisprudential or political stances wey some Ulama expressed for di course of dia Quranic trfseer sessions
ova many many years, dia bin don dey unnecessary controversy ova say wich charitable work better pass between make dem dey suponsor broadcast Quranic tafseer abi make dem dey do charitable mass feeding of di needy for Ramadan. 
As e dey go for oda Muslim societies, Ramadan dey always inspire a phenomenal risefor individual and for societal spirituality for Nigeria wer plenty  wealthy pipo dey sponsorlive or recorded broadcast for Quranic tafseer by different Ulama
Many oda pipo dey spend more on top charitable feeding of di poor.
Howeva, while almost, if no be all, who dey sponsor di broadcast tafseerb dey spend for di charitable feeding too, no be all wey dey spend for charitable feeding dey suponsor di broadcast of tafseer.
Ramadan period for northern Nigeria, television and radio stations dey make profit wit di sale of airtime for tafseer and oda religious lectures wey individual, firms and groups sponsor
from di kin number of sponsor broadcast of tafseer an dem oda religious lecture wey dey for like 10 radio stations for Kano, for example, one fit begin dey wonda weda dem dey do oda programme for Ramadam period. 
E good say dem dey sponsor tafseer broadcast, especially for Ramadan, di amount wey dem dey spend for dis regard be like say im dey imbalance if we consider di kin hunger wey dey wire di needy 
afta all, if dem get chance to choose, dem go certainly choose food hangout ova dat kin sponsored broadcast, as e don be say public tafseer session dey evriwia for Ramadan wey persin fit choose wich to attend.
Besides, di kin underlying dynamics and politics wey dey for sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast, persin no fit rule out Riyaa, sectarian and even political interest wey be di main motives for di sponsor of tafseer and dem oda religious lectures.
Wetin dey interesting be say, while some sponsor dey compete for who go sponsor di broadcast of tafseer wey some prominent Ulama dey anchor, some of di Ulama dey sponsor dia own broadcast tafseer even if dem no see persin wey wan sponsor;  odas even dey beg for sponsor wey go sponsor dia programme.
Also, di content wey some tafseer and oda religious lectures dey feature get some serious flaws, to dey sponsor dis kin broadcast nah big misplacement of priority
anoda thing wey dey interesting be say, some dey sponsor di broadcast of Adhan ( Kiran sallah) for inside city like Kano. 
wia, thank you to sheer wey dey increase for Mosques, regular Adhan don dey reach evri corner 
Anyway, Ikhlas bin di ogbonge yardstick way dey determine if weda charitable feeding and di sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer  broadcast dey worthy or not, striking appropriate balance between di two go give better outkom.
Even though say Ramadan be di month of di Quran wey be say Muslims suppose dey commited in terms of reading, learning wetin im mean and to dey live dia lives accordingly
Di month nah di month of generous charity wey be say Muslims, particularly di ones wey dey wealthy suppose dey do charity work, especially mass feeding.
Howeva, while dat one com be di bottom line, wich explain why di controversy no dey necessary, di Liberal Musilims don over do am
capitalizing on top public frustration wey dey inside di hunger wey dey wire di society, dem dey kwesion weda di sponsoring of di broadcast Ramadan tafseer dey worthy or relevance for under dis kin condition wey we dey find ourselves.
As dem don pretend show empathy and concern, dey tok say di two charity work be di same and make pipo choose between dem.
Under di hard condition wey pipo dey, e no surprise to dey see many pipo, including di ones wey fit discern, fall for di propaganda wey dem no know e context, nah im be di raging face-off wey dey between di Liberal Muslims, for anoda side, dem bin wan undermine Islamic and moral values for di society by force, togada with di
Also, contrary to wetin dem claim, di Liberal Muslims no dey disturb by di kin wahala wey dey for di vulnerable, dis don explain why dem neva urge those wey dey spend huge resources on top oda things, no mater how worthless im be, make dem divert di resources to charitable course.
Dem neva urge dat di kin massive amounts of  resources dia elite role spend on top say dey wan maintain dia big lifestyles suppose dey diverted for di feeding of di poor or to take give dem shelter 
Instead, dia conscience go kom alive wen resources dey for only, say, Hajj, Umrah, Daourh
Federers conqueror dey amazed by dream day wey dey di office
Afta  im don wreck, Roger Federers return to di tennis courts, Pablo Andujar tok say dat na di sweetest moment a lengthy career.

with di kin ups and downs wey dey for Nigeria, im still allow me get dream, to be artist wey dey work for a ogbonge culture company wey for anoda kontiri, anoda continent
Fast-forward to 20002, one day as I dey sit down for di post office wey dey di centre of di city to drop off my latest art sample to Marvel Submission Editor, I no fit get bus
Plenty pipo dey use leg take waka, some gada for group, dem dey worry.
I dey weird out, waka go home, only to hear say raiot don start.
again, many pipo die for di riot, farmilies and friends tear apart as Christian dey beingn move to Kaduna South and Muslims begin move from Kaduna South to di North 
My Kaduna, my Nigeria, don dey fall apart.
Di small consolation wey I get be some Christian friend wey stay for certain areas, like me, dem feel safe and no go anywia
So,  as di violence dey intense for oda parts, I go dey play soccer for my street, dey exchange VHS tapes and bootlegs VCDs
Di idea to dey hate persin bikos of im religion or ethnic dey incredible for us.
But one teen, wey just move to our domot some years, nah im make me get encounter with intolerance.
if to say we be Muslims, playing soccer, dis new guy call us make we go attack di infidel wey dey live down di road.
we com look each oda jokingly, we dey confuse, afta wich we burst to laughter, we com tell say make im get out.
As if dat one no bad reach, my heartbreak for don worse as I see di apprearance of labels and slur from both of dem.
My perfect Kaduna don dey fall apart, and families and friends don dey part ways, no be say dem no love each oda but bikos say dat na di safest thing to do.
afta di wahala don end, I begin face university with cautious optimism.
literally, many old friend dey there, as Zaria no too far from Kaduna.
Many pipo dey get new friend, some dey till today, some don dey stronger 
The best part be say, all dis friend dem weda new or old, no dey base on religion or ethnicity
Some of us wey notice know say, di Kaduna wey we know, love and don lose, neva really destroy. 
E no fit go bikos say nah for our heart im reside, so e go hard to kil patapata
Afta all di almost 29 years wey I don spend as a journalist, show me things wey plenty pipo no fit experience for dia life.
I get front row seat to fight for, gbege attack, concerts by superstars dem, movies premieres and all kin generation-defining moments
I also get to dey interview for some big big newsmaker wey dey Nigeria, during moment wey dem get most chutzpah, or nothin at all.
Nah di Nigeria wey no get worrior wey no fit fight for  social justice, virtue-signalers, outrage-peddlers, or cancel culture- purveyor.
Nah di Nigeria wey dey flawed, still dey remind me of my old Kaduna, even though di image different to each oda.
But bodi no fit take all of dem for too long.
On top of bed, I con look around my old room again, evrithin just dey as I leave am before im coronavirus lockdown.
I com smile to myself, nah from dat moment I begin to dey decide on di kin steps wey I go take.
I com twist di rubber band round di sack of fotos two times, com put am back for inside longbox.
Maybe one day I go look oda ones, di colour foto, wey carry more recent memories.
Maybe I no go do am.
One thing dey clear say: nah my mother, and father, and di kin relationship wey dem get or wey dem no get wit me, nah im make me di kin child wey I be. 
Wetin I be to oda kids wey know me, also di kin man wey I be, to pipo wey know me.
But I find am as wahahla, and e dey relieve more for my sack of black and white fotos, I don realize say while my head guide di kin persin wey I be, nah my heart don dey keep me Nigerian all dis years.
42 Niger communities wey dey under Boko Haram dey control Senator Musa. 
Di Senator wey dey represent Niger East for di National Assembly, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, im tok say about 42 communities wey dey Niger State don fall under Boko Haram control.
Dem don showcase 5,000 villagers for di last three days.
Dis dey kom after Niger state governor, Sani Bello, don raise alarm say di insurgents don hoist dia flag for some communities.
Speaking on di ground of senate on Tuesday while dem dey move on a motion on di kilins wey dey apun for Shiroro, Muya and Rafi local goment areas for Niger state, Senator Musa tok say bandit and terrorist don kil ova 475 persins for Niger East between 2020 till date. 
Di lawmakers don express im worry dat almost seven years now Niger East Senatorial Districts wey dey Niger Delta don dey under eviriday and dey sustain plenty deadly attack by heartless, venomous, hydraheaded Boko Haram terrorist.
Di result don dey total collapse wey dey di local economies of di affected victims, total collapse of educational system for di affected areas, famine don dey bikos of di collapse of agricultural activities, displacement wey be as a result of distortion of crisis prone areas, depopulation as a result of wanton death, wey dey among odas.
Im tok say di attack are taking places for di absence of di slightest hindrances, resistance of confrotation from authorities.
Dem don kidnap many and don seize dem wives from dem com forcefully attached dem to Boko Haram members.
Three military camps wey dey Allour, Bassa and Zagzaga for di two local goment area don get sack, di insurgents don kil some security personnel in di last one month of di renewed attack
I fit confirm am authoritatively say Boko Haram terrorist don mount dia flags for many places wey dem don capture like Kure, Alour and Magani
Dey don abandoned pipo wey dey dis wat-torn part of di states and leave dem make dem face dia wahala, make dem dey in agony wey no get end and dey deep inside poverty.
 futhermore, for dis moment primary schools for Gwada,Kuta, Pandogari and Minna dem don carry dem do IDP camp as dem dey follow di sacking of almost 5600 villagers from dia ancestral homes in Shiroro, Rafi and Munya local goment area for di last few weeks by di armed rubber  wey don raid  di town and villages.
Wetin dis mean be say if dey fit attack without hindrance for Niger East Senatorial districts. 
I no know how we wan take bikom safe for Abujan again.
Im tok say March 2021 to date some jaguda don kil more 25 gallant soldier dem, policemen and oda security personnel while 16 civillians die, and dem no fit account for many odas.
If dem no address dis threat drastically, di attack go continue and di danger wey day dat one be say e fit bikom wetin we no fit handle further to oda communities.
Wey bin farming communities and dem bin farmers, dem fit comot dia farm dis season and dis fit negatively affect food surficiency and economic diversification policy of di Federal Goment, im added.
My visit go Adamour state
Working wit di goment for any level don offer innovators like me di chance to dey bring more beta and transformation wey we ordinarily no fit do for our field 
I strongly believe say di goment, as institution, be di greatest vehicle for systemic change and positive transformation wey persin no fit find anywia.
For dat, weneva I kom across opportunities to work wit dem goment bodi, weda local or nah for outside country, I dey always dey hapi bikos say e represent a great opportunity for me learn from and fit contribute to di civil service wey dey fields dat are exciting and dey transformative for pipo beyond wetin my
One of my recent visit of such nature nah to Adamour state, wey dey fascinating for me bikos of im diversity, resilience and outstanding potencial.
I begin dey work actively for Adamour state some years ago, wit di international organisation, OXFAM, on top a project wey dey in line wit European Union's support to food security and resilience for Nothen Nigeria were we deployed a mobile solution to integrating di agricultural value chain.
We don work wit field officers wey dey represent Fufore,Guyuk,Mubi South and Song local goment areas wey dey Adamour state to enhance agriculture and Agricbusiness practices wit tecnology.
Howeva, my return to Adamour state last year dey towards a grannder and dey get more exciting task.
E don involve a preposition to take work wit di state goment to transform di ministry of Entrepreneurship and Development and poverty Alliviation togeda wit di wealth creation Agency( PAWECA) wit di general aim of how to dey reduce poverty and dey sustainably dey improve prosperity for di teeming young pipo wey dey di state.
For some context, I dey very delighted to learn dat di state goment don establish di ministry of entrepreneurship and Development wey go help lay focus on entrepreneurship and to acquire technical skil.
E no exist untill di goment of Ahmadu Umar Fintiri administration com establish am, di ministry don bikom di key pillar of di administration strategies wey dey towards economic development of di state.
Di role of dis institution dey sailent as im supporse be for Adamour state, wit im fair share of youth unemployment, security and oda challenges.
Im dey, howeva, very very evident dat the Adamour state ministry of Entrepreneurship and development, togeda wit Poverty Alleviation and Wealth Creation Agency (PAWECA), e fit dey adequately utilised for trasforming di local economy, boosting youth entrepreneurship and to dey reduce unemployment drastically for di state.
But as im be for most goment institutions, dis dey require discipline and dedicated effort to fit achieve dem
Typically, for wia dey exist, complex international organisational challenges don shackle di growth and efficiency of dis kin institutions.
For persin to understand dis conundrum, I tok to Adamour state's secretary to di state goment, Malam Bashiru Ahmed, who no dey only passionate about di issue but dey remarkably informed about local and global effort wey dey around am and as such uniquely position to help chat oury solving am
Im repeat Governor Fintiri commitment to take solve youth wey no get job and enhance di local economy by boosting entrepreneurship.
Malam Bashiru don express im idea and understanding wey dey around reforming and improving di  capacity of ministries and agencies of goment, arguing dat di desire transformation only fit be possible if dem enhance di culture of innovation, embrace di use of technology, and if dem improve internal processeces and procedures so dat
Nah bikos of di challege wey most public and private institution dey seek to solve continue to dey generate demands wey only technologically savvy, innovation-driven, forward thinking, and efficient institution fit do.
In di course of di weeks to follow afta dis encounter, I also meet di Commissioner of di Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Youth Development, Ilya James and di head of Poverty Alliviation and Wealth Creation (PAWECA) Hajiya Aisha Bello, make dem examine wetin dem have and dia lay grounds for developing initiatives base on
we wan establish organisational culture wey dey efficient and fit give result and go equip di ministry and agency to bikom innovation-driven through di use of technology.
In a way wey dey demostrable and fit give result we go initiate human-centre design thinking among staff and optimaize internal processes to ensure quality service delivery
last last, we go offer tools wey go dey for di monioring and measuring of organaisational performance of di ministry agency.
Dis go go hand in hand for di already existing togada wit newly-hatched programs and campaings of di two institutions
Governor fintiri administration, by im sheer resolve and commitment wey dey towards capacity development ey dey in partnership wit various global and indeed local partner like di United Nation and Development Programme (UNDP) and di Nigerian Content Development Board (NCDB), upgrading vocational and fabrication centres like di vocational
I dey quite inspired by di kin obsession wey Governor Fintiri get for local content participation policies wey dey all project and programme, wey dey evident for di goment derive for local content participation in di NEDC rapid response projects togeda wit bin di key galvaniser and pivot wey dey di North East Governor's forum.
As I land for Yola dis week, di state capital of Adamour, amidst all dis aspirations for di great Fombina, as dem dey call di religion historically, I dey beset wit a renewed melanchonly for di loss of one of di greatest sons of Adamour, and Nigeria ogbonge public servant and academic Dr. Mahmud Tukur, who for im life time don
We pray make Allah grant im great rewards, and make us fulfill im dream and aspiration for Nigeria as a whole.

If di police and military withdraw and den brigands becom enforcers of di law and order, if you get quarrel wit your broda, how you wan take resolve am?
While we still dey demand for national apology for di kin treatment dem dey meted to di Igbos during di nation's three-year civil war, Governor Ikpeazu tok say our national orientation suppose dey willing to say sorry.

Even wen we wey deal wit our pikin dem if we do things wey no dey right, we suppose get di courage to come down to dia level and tell dem sorry but to create a utopian aura dat all dey well is either nothing is wrong

Musa don add say dat di protest be don start for around 3:00 for afternoon and dey go serere from Sky Memorial but just dem wan scatta for Wuse Market, di police arrive and start to dey shoot teargas and life ammunition on di peaceful and unarmed protesters.

Di FCT police command spokespesin, ASP Maryam Yusuf, tok say di group dem dey disturb public peace wit dia protest.
NAPTIP, for di press briefing  at di weekend, tok say Abdulrahman, a 32-year-old man, him abducted children wey dem dey di age of four to seven and sell dem to some women wey dey different parts of di kontiri wey dey under di guise of say im adoption dem.
Di Director General, Mrs. Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim, wen im dey hand ova di children to dia parents im say, di suspect tell di would be parents adoption papers purportedly from di Niger State Goment.
She tok say, dem catch am red handed wen im dey help im clients fill dia adoption application forms.
She warn say make parents dem dey guard dia children dem  to avoid kidnapping wey dey apun, trafficking and oda crimes dem wey dey against humanity, she add say make dem no expose dem to pipo wey get criminal intention.
She tok say di pesin wey dey investigate di matta don follow an intelligence report dat Abdulrahman  kidnapped children from Niger State and com sell dem into different parts of di kontiri.
Di DG also tok say di intelligence report don reveal that di suspect bin don dey do dat claiming to be a staff of di Ministry of Social Development of Niger State wey dey in charge of adoption dem matta.

Governors dem wey dem elect on di platform of di pipos Democratic parti (PDP) don warn di Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) make dem no dey witch-hunt im parti officials dem.
Di governors dem don dey respond to di invitation of three officials of di parti by di antigraft agency ova alleged misappropriation of N10 billion, which the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) wey dem don already deny.
di forum, for di statement by im Director-General, Hon CID Maduabum, tok say di invitation of di officials ova a spurious petition by a disgruntled former member of PDP don raise quesion on di seriousness and impartiality of di anti-graft agency to do im work.
Di statement tok: While PDP as a political parti dey accountable to im members dem and di general public for im actions, we dey, howeva, concerned dat di old tactics of using di EFCC to dey silence political opposition don dey entre into our polity again.
we think say di EFCC wey dey di new leadership go learn from di mistake of pipo wey dey before am.
Nah misplaced priority e be for EFCC to dey abandon revelations of big big fraud wey many officials and agencies of di Federal goment dey do  to pursue di PDP wey be di main opposition parti doing a yeoman's job to dey prevent di descent into chaos and anarchy for inside Nigeria.
Maybe some interests inside goment dey worried about di increasingly assertive role di PDP dey play in calling out corruption inside goment and wan to weaken and silence am.
Even di message wey dem dey tok about no make any allegation of misuse of goment funds, or cheating of any persin or public authority by di PDP.
E dey surprising dat EFCC wan use im scarce human and oda resources to begin investigation into PDP finances.
If EFCC dey even-handed and dey non-partisan, e suppose conduct investigation into oda political parties including APC, wey be  di ruling party.
PDP dey up to date for making financial returns as di required by the Constitution to INEC
We no know say INEC don make complaints to EFCC on PDP's return.
We dey face existential threats as a nation and PDP suppose remain focus on im role as a watchdog on behave of Nigerians.

dia education don suffer
plenty of dem no get access to healthcare.
Dem no get any recreation for dem
Dem dey abuse some of di girls.
Dem dey live inside di fear of di unknown.

Di economic impact of COVID-19 on dia parent dey affect di children in a nagative way.
Di quality of food wey dem dey chop don reduce to and some of dem no fit go school again, nah wetin im tok be dat.
Di lawmaker don call for effective implementation of policies and programmes wey go aim at providing betta education and betta health care for di children
Di investment wey put for our children nah di investment wey we put for di future of our kontiri. 
Im add say, make we no fail for dis regards.
Wetin dey fuel insurgency?
Wen a group of pipo wey no dey informed get an idealogy wey dey fit die for, dem go do di illogical for am.
Di kind intercourse wey dey between ideology and ignorance no dey follow logic.
Dem consider murder as di sin wey dealy pass for Igbo land.
In fact, for di old days if dem committe murder, di community go proceed on many days of cleansing of di land and atonement for di crime.
Wetin change now?
plenty pipo don assume dat di Igbo are natively no dey violence and dat dey cannot in any circumstances dey take innocent lives violently.
Di Igbo pipo dey very peaceful, but wetin dey apun recently inside South-east don make us to dey doubt di assumption 
All di regions inside di kontiri don dey marginalise as regards say di equitable distribution of resources to di pipo.
To dey clear, nah evri region don dey marginalise

E dey so agonising say di scion of di south-east don dey turn dia region into Aleppo inside Syria. 
Nah who bring war and violence into im own home?
As of 2019, di south-east dey reputed say e dey very safe pass any oda region for inside Nigeria.
E dey very buoyant and dey well fared on top di development inside index.
All of dat don dey tremble down.
Di kilin of police officers some of dem Igbo di targeting of northern residents; di destruction of property and arsoning of police stations dem be di tragedies wey no suppose apun.
Dem dey fed di cancer and dem allow am spread throughout di bodi. 
Di Igbo dem nourish dis beast wey dey gnawing at dia groin. 
Wen dem start di serial murder of police officers, some clap for di effort of dia kilers on di inscrutable assumption say di police dey inside cahoots wit criminals to destroy Igbo land.
Now, di destruction of di region no dey for di hands of some herdsmen or bandits, but for di might of di sons of di land.
How you wan take define irony?
Dem dey threaten di Igbo pipo wey get different opinions to di group sentiments wit violence.
Dem no know di Igbo to get strong head or conscripted into tyranny of opinions and actions
Dem know Igbo to be republican; dem dey open to robust arguments and dem dey subject evri thought to scrutiny.
Wetin com change?
He be like say di kilin of police officers inside di south-east bin don dey unmitigated and security agencies don appear to don leave di pipo to dia own fate.
Armed robber dem don return at scale.
Nah dis be pipo lamentation evriwia.
A lady wey share her experience of how a mechanic wey she pay upfront to fix her car inside  Anambra runaway wit di moni and automobile, and even threatened her while im dey brag, police no dey inside di south-east again.
Jaguda don take control of interest areas inside di region.
Fear and wahala dey evriwia. 
Life don bikom nasty, brutish and short inside a region wey dey peaceful before.
As a mata of fact, we dey on a familiar path albeit dey dangerous
Di signs dey very tragic
Pikin wey dem born for Nigeria in 2000 fit tell how Boko Haram take start inside North-east.
Di militant groups dey ourys target di security agents and formations eviritime.
Wen dey take dem out, di pipo no go fit defence demselves and di armed gangs go start a new order of violence.
 Dem don kill securities and dem destroy security facilities in di South-east now
Afta di security scaffold don dey decimated, innocent pipo wey dey live di area and even those wey dey satisfied ova di revelry of blood fit bikom di next victims.
Dem be displaced persins wey dey live inside IDP camps for inside part of Eboyi state displace, dis apun as a result of interncine clashes among communities.
Wit di kin prevailing savagery wey di secessionist group, there go be more refugee problem inside south-east if dem continue wit di attack.
wia dey wan put pipo wey be say wetin dem dey do nah buying and selling?
we no fit end dis barbarity if we no agree
If some pipo choose to keep native sympathies for pipo wey dey take innocent lives, how go fit stop di bloodletting stop?
E dey for our hand.

Di EU don extend di ban from 2018 on importation of dry beans from Nigeria until June 2019 bikos of di pesticide wey dey always dey der
Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service (NAQS), di kontri produce regulator, don assure di farmers and oda stakeholders before say di kontri dey work hard to ensure say dem lift di ban for 2021
One recent document from EU don announce extension of di ban, he tok say Nigeria no implement di Union food safety plan wey dem submit for 2018

Na like dis e don be for five years
How e take start
For 2015, dem reject some beans from Nigeria bikos of di Eu export regulations
One official for NAQS tell awa Agric Editor say as e reach Tin Can Island, di NAQS team go check di consignment and dey discover say some of di containers don dey turn power and dey reject am bikos of di chemical residue 
We take awa own analysis from there, kom discover say aside from di pesticide residue wey dey, pest sef dey and na dem kos di powder form of di beans
He tok say di agency don dey carry out serious campaign to explain how and di reason for farmers and middlemen make dem dey preserve dia beans wit acceptable chemical level
Di official, wey no write hin name down, tok say aside from export wahala, to dey chop beans wey dey don too preserve dey dangerous to human and animal health.
Expert tok say Nigeria dey lose billions 
One agric economist, Mr Segun Ayeni, tell Daily trust yesterday say Nigeria dey lose billions of naira sake of di ban wey dey kontri beans mata wey EU give dem for 2015.

Di German don lead Chelsea go FA Cup aand Champions League final, as he dey take dem go Champions League top-four back
If hin win hin Maiden Silverware for English football, e go be evidence of Tuchel impact
But Leichester wey get two points pass Chelsea for Champions League, go be serious threat for Tuchel ambition, as he be say na under dia boss Brendan Rogers correct guidance dem dey

Di institute release like 20 variety for cowpea sef and 66 different maize variety, afta, 13 different variety of cotton
Dey get economic attributes wey dey veri important wey go increase di income of farmers and provide different product for utilisation, whether na as food, fiber, or for makin textile products for cotton case, or even if na to provide oil groundnut and cotton case.
Di IAR don wake di concience of farmers generally make dem know say modern technologies dey

For example, planter and tractors don dey wey dem fit use hand hold
And we don dey find way wey we go use perfect rollin weeders bikos pipo don dey complain say farmers dey use hoe wey dem dey use hand hold comot weed 
Na so we answer dem wit di mechanical weeder wey we dey develop
we get thresher dem for maize, beans, sorghum and groundnut
Dryers dey important wen you produce crop wen rain still dey fall, so you need find place wia you go fit dry dem
hin tok say dryin sef dey important if you wan store product like tomato
somethin new for ginger seed
He kom continue tok say IAR sef enta one area for science wey just dey emerge wey dem call biotechnology
awa scientists don dey develop wetin dem go use propagate crops fast
For example, we get order make we for micro-propagate ginger .
Na how your plantin material plenti reach go determine di ginger production, di plantin material dem dey veri expensive, na hin make awa scientist dem develop way wey be say you fit develop like 1 to 2 inches of ginger piece inside bottle
You fit produce more dan 200  plantlets wey dem fit grow for field
Right now, we dey receive order from some farmer wey dey find am.
We dey do am for sugarcane sef
Dis technique dey help to propagate disease-free crop, sometimes, plantin materials fit don get disease
Na as your plant reach, na hin di disease sef dey propagate for odas
But dis technique dey try purify material make dem dey disease-free
Na Tissue Cultural Technique dey call am, na der dem dey plant for bottle, make e for proliferate
Each plantet fit give rise to plenti plantet now etc.
New technology for bio-fertiliser, Irrigation
Technology as we develop am dey go through two stage
Di first stage dey scientific
For this part, scientist dem go don dey sure say dis technique get di kind technology or tool wey dem go fit use solve di kasala, afta, di farmers go test am diasef.
Den, based on farmers opinion, dem fit still propagate am
So, for di area crop variety wey i don dey count give you for di last few years now, we don release variety of cowpea wey dey insect-resistant.
Na SAMPEA20T dem call maize own; na di same year wey we release six different maize wey get potential to yield 6-8 tonne per hectare and for 2020 den.
Dem release three types for improved sorghum (sweet sorghum), wit anoda six type of maize
For dis recent time, na wetin we release be dat
We wan release one technology for bio-fertiliser, na capsule wey get of some kind material,wey kom still get some kind microorganism wey dey useful as e be say dem fit help fix nitrogen, wey go benefit how plants take dey grow and develop as dem add fertilizer sef
He tok say we don develop develop technique for irrigation wey we improve so e go dey reduce how farmers take dey waste water.

To tame Nigeria oil spillage and gas flarin scourge
E kom from Jerome Mario-Utami
Di recent news report say Okordia-Rumekpe 14-inch crude truck line wey Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) dey operate discharge 213 barrel crude oil for Ikarama community for Bayelsa don reach awa side say though Nigeria wey been dey proud say dey be giant of Africa and di black kontri wey get pipo pass for di world stil dey get plenti third world kasala
As dem dey clarify say na like 1.34 hectare land dem pollute wit di leakage wey rupture for di pipeline follow, SPDC confirm say dey finish di investigation of di incident, dey tok say out of 213 of SPDC bonny light crude leak, na like 110 barrel dem see recover for di recovery exercise wey dem dey do for di site, e kom remain 109.12 barrel of di volume wey spill.
Admittedly, wetin Dutch oil giant claim na fact wey dem fit verify but e fit no be di only explanation
Notwitstandin dia clarification,reasons dey wey qualify dis kind apunin for Nigeria oil and gas industry as reality wey dey suppose analyse generally
Make we start wit reality
Aside from di awareness say spillage dey happen, communal right for environment wey clean and access for clean water supply na hin dey don violate for dat kind case, wit dia admission, dey don abandon thousands of site wey dey don pollute for di region, wey dem nid identify and study for detail as dey compensate di community wey e affect well for dia loss wella, dis lastest spill apun weeks afta one wey resemble am for one pipeline facility wey rupture wey one International Oil company wey dey  operate for Niger Delta dey manage, wey dem report say destroy Benikrukru and commuinty wey dey around am for Warri South-west local goment Area for Delta state.
And anoda one for early momo on Sunday, March 14,2021 for Polubobu / Opuama, Warri North local Goment Area for di state, go fit settle.
Dis kind big scale set of spillage also include but e no dey limited to; di big spillage wey dey history for place like Ogini land, Rivers State and Erovie community for Ozoro, Isoko North Local Goment for Delta state for 1990s, di two for Nigeria south south zone and negative impact still dey der.
Shey na di only explanation /example dem be dis?
Di answer na ogbonge
no, as oda ones dey
Oda critical reason / concern dem why we suppose see di situation as crisis.
Di first and veri important na di inability of Nigeria and hin pipo to appreciate and treat activity wey relate to crude oil spillage and environment pollution wey dey kom from exploration/crude oil production as national calamity
Di second na di stunnin conciousness wey gas flarin/ environment degradation dey apun bikos of activities wey dey related to crude oil prospectin/ production for di kontri dey under-reported.
Dis second concern dey kom from one recent comment, wey be say from media report na from di Director-General, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, wey tok say wetin hin agency find show say average of five oil spills na hin Nigeria dey record evriday.
Musa, wey follow journalists tok for Abuja, tok say for 2018, we get 600 oil spill incident and for 2019, we get about 700 oil spill-impacted site actross di kontri.
Dis comment wey dey open brain dey more important for wetin we dey discourse if pesin remember say Nigeria accordin to report don get about 139 place wey gas don flare across Niger Delta both for di oil fields wey dey water and di one wey no dey, wer gas wey dey flare dey reach 11% of evrithin wey dem dey produce.
Pass anything, na di question dem wey e bring kom mind be; wetin dey stop di development of petroleum sector and Niger Delta region
Shey Legislative work no dey?
Why dis kind legislative framework no dey provide strong source of solution for pipo and community wey oil exploration and production affect badly for coastal comminity dem?
If dis framework dey, why e no dey work or make dem do am?
Shey di framework get evrithin  like legal solution for di issues of violations wey relate to oil?
Why di nation neva learn serious lesson from Dutch goment wia all di pipo wey dey operate must restore wia dem dey operate back to how dey meet am?
Regardless of wetin oda pipo tok, di truth be say if all of us get am for mind to develop policy wey go bring prosperity for oil and gas sector, while we go still save di pipo for di region, we ready to find di strategic triangles wey hold di key to success for hand.
Apart from di fact say success need make dem analyse am wit care, of di different kind of knowledge wey dem need to make innovation possible, e don necessary for di nation make dem hold di middle ground since both di ministry and sector don dey manifest signs for long time now say dem go be institution wey no get potential wey strong.
And as we know, any organization, whether private or public wey no gree search for hin potential, hin survival na by chance.
For dis level, if we luk di operational template of di ministry, and how dey don know say di up, mid and down stream players of di petroleum industry say dem no dey follow rules, e no go dey wrong make pesin conclude say dem fit divide di serious reasons wey dey kos Crude oil spillage/gas flarin to; regulatory framework wey plenti wey no dey work, oil and gas exploration and production for Nigeria dey; federal goment failure to make di kontri refineries dey work to dia full capacity back ; petroleum ministry inability to make International Oil Companies dey follow di international best practices as e relate to di environment wey dem dey work; Di last one, clear responsibility/work details wey no dey and action plans for agencies and parastatals wey dey function under di ministry.
Di failures dem wey dey up get direct consequence, na bad influence for di sector, di ministry and di region.
To take explain dis points, make we use di first challenge start, e dey important to dey tok about di law dem wey regulate crude oil exploration and oil production issue wey plenti law dey regulate but too dey weak and di Acts wey dey law wey no dey just complicate how e dey work, but e don too old as time don dey change, e dey create corner corner way for pipo wey dey operate for der especially the International Oil Companies (IOC)  make dem fit use exploit both di goment and host communities.
some of dis laws/acts wey we dey tok about don dey since 1960 but dey no dey achieve dia purpose wey Di Petroleum Act of 1969, Di Harmful Waste(Special Criminal Positions etc), Act 1988, Mineral Oil Safety Regulation 1963, Petroleum(Drillin and Production) Regulation 1969 dey but no be oly dis one dem.
(Subsidiary Legislation to Petroleum Act) and di off-shore Oil Revenue (Registration of Grants) Acts 1971 among odas.
As dey no mind di number, concept, provision and definition dem, dis law dem no dey useful again, dey don old to di extent say dem dey give pipo wey dey work for di sector corner corner to dey chop both di goment and host community dem.
Utomi na di Programme Coordinator (Media and Policy), Social and Econnomic Justice Advocacy (SEJA) , Lagos.
Crystal and Davy (1969) explain say di language wey journalist dem dey use dey important for di journalism work.
SEC ban CMO wey dey no register from operation May 31
Di Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tok say dem go stop Capital Market Operators (CMOs) operation wey neva renew dia registration for May 31
Di commission tok am for one circular wey di management sign on Monday for Abuja
Di commission tok say any CMO wey no renew dia registration before late fillin expire for May 31 no go fit operate for capital market.
Bikos of wetin dey apun, di commission tok say to dey fill di renewal of registration late go dey between May 1 to May 30
E tok say di CMOs need complete renewal process on or before April 30.
Di commission note say dem go publish di name of di CMOs wey renew dia registration of SEC website and national newspapers dem.
E kom add say dem go declare di name of CMOs wey dey eligible give relevant security exchange and Trade Associations.
Di News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report say SEC for March don share circular give general public and di CMOs for di periodic renewal of registration by di operator wey dey wan introduce again
Di simple quality wey journalism language get na to dey clear, and wetin e wan show pass na make pipo fit understand am.

IPOB leader don threaten pipo say hin go dey kil pipo wey no reason wit am
IPOB Emma Powerful don threaten pipo say he go spill blood.
Emma Powerful wey be media and publicity secretary for IPOB threat to dey kil any Igbo pesin wey no follow hin warning don dey too serious, and dey no suppose ignore am except say we no get goment, wer small small fascist like Mr Emma Powerful as he call himsef go dey tok say hin go dey drag pipo kom out, dey send dem go meet Baba God as he tok bikos dey no follow am or hin organization.
Di mouth wey hin dey run no be play; as e be say di kasala for Nigeria South-east show say na plan dey plan am.
As he no understand how simple Igbo leadership dey be, wey be say dia leader na Onye-oje ozi or servant of hin pipo, wey make di pipo agree wit am afta he don consult plenti pipo, Emma Powerful wey prefer one thug title, Onye-ike, wey be say na to dey force dem, make dem fear am and now he dey threaten to kil di same Ndigbo wey he say he dey fight for.
For man wey be say he no dey tolarate, wey be say to kil pipo take push hin cause no be kasala, di question be say who go wan stay tru tru for Cave Republic wey be say na thug dey run am
Di Biafra wey pipo know for history no be Ndigbo choice; Na di only choice wey dem force Ndigbo do be dat for dat time, wey dem face bravely wit plenti courage and sacrifice so dem go fit defend and uphold
Biafra no too oppose authority reach how dey try make di pipo right dey valid, no be say make dem just exist, but na to live wit dignity.
Di Biafra wey dey history na like safety precaution for all Igbo pipo wey suppose don too suffer dat time fit kom, place wey dey fit stay safely.
Di declaration and di struggle of di old Biafra no be show or avenue to make moni wey di pipo wey dey lead am dey do pass now.
Before dem declare Biafra for 1967, Eastern Consultative assembly, one group wey dey represent, still dey advice for all di opinion wey pipo get for east, bikos of wetin dey apun gree say make dem make di declaration wit dia authority.
Na di reason wey make di whole Ndigbo and oda tribe wey no be Igbo, wey sacrifice, wey dem no fit forget gree protect di republic wey still small
As di war dey end sef, wey Biafra don fall, wey evribodi don settle, Ndigbo go back go protect Nigeria, wit clean mind, strong determination and courage, so e go fit work,
Di context of new Nigeria kasala and disagreement for dia point of view wey dey deep na bikos of one neo-capitalist state wey dey go backward, and di chain of di productive forces, wey dem chain, wey no fit produce di material of hin existence again.
As di new Nigeria kasala dey grow, wey e no dey progress and e slow, di simple tins like tribe, culture and religion dey struggle to preserve, express and recreate diasef.
ova-all, e dey easy to carry retirement flag, wen dey no understand how socio-economic infrastructure dey important if dey wan build kontri wey go survive.
South Sudan wey be Africa last born still dey breastfeed as dia condition now worse pass dia former condition.
Notin show say Biafra current leader wey like to dey make noise know anythin about how dem dey build or create kontri
Even if dem dey independent, to built state no dey di real deal, to dey command pipo witout respect , make di fascist leaders like Emma Powerful wey dey threaten to kil pipo don show already.
Ndigbo too posh to get leaders wey be thug and tout, wey no understand say Igbo political culture and framework na to dey consult elders.
Mr Nnamdi Kanu wey been dey command dem, no know any village for Igboland apart from hin own, dey claim to be dia leader like say na hin own, pipo wey be say he no know how dem dey live except for di moni wey hin dey send give dem from abroad.
Mr Emma "di Powerful" wey be dia media and publicity secretary don use hin arrogance and petty fascist inpunity spoil Igbo basic framework wey be say na to dey consult pipo and to dey agree for somethin generally before dey do am.
Na only organisation wey thug full dey threaten to destroy pipo wey no gree wit am.
But dis new threat wey Mr Emma "de Powerful" issue say he go send pipo go meet dia forefathers sake of say dem no follow am, don too much.
Sake of dat one reason, dey suppose find way restrict hin and hin pipo to avoid kasala
Onunaiju dey write from Abuja
Education for Nigeria don spoil finish bikos of di greed wey di leaders of association wey relate to am get
Old syllabus and way wey dem dey use teach na anoda kasala wey don add the ones wey dey ground.

Luka Istifanus: FCT no go hire athletes wey go win National Sports Festive Medals
how e dey go as you don resume office as di acting Director of Sports in the FCT

in all, we dey grateful because we do better dan 21 states
with di support of di government, we go do better at Delta 2022
di national sports festival don dey open
how your athletes take cope with dia opponents wey get more experience
the task no dey easy unto say some states don go far as di USA, France and Germany to hire athletes
For FCT here, na government funding we depend on solely
state don give official money wey reach N15m make e go use am monitor proceedings for combat sports
na di money wey some states struggled get to attend the festival
for us, even before we go Benin city, minister don charge us make we dy responsible to ur behaviors and be worthy ambassadors
hin advised say make we no try win by all means
na him farewell message to us and we abided by it
we no go outside FCT go look for athletes
na dat exact thing we do
Luka Istifanus: FCT no go  hire athletes make dem go  win National Sports Festival medals
Di acting director in sports for FCT, Luka Istifanus don frown at di reckless poaching of athletes by di big money spenders as e don vow say di FCT no go waka about dey pay athletes to win National Sports Festival medals
For dis interview wey dem get wit Trust sports, di acting director don yarn on top di performance of team FCT for Edo 2020 and sports development for di Federal Capital Territory
How e dey go as you don resume office as di acting Director of Sports in di FCT?
Di rate wey dem dey take smuggle no be small
Na me take over as di acting director of sports in di FCT on di 8th day of october 2020 and so tey dat time my major concern na how I go take sports for di Territory beyond wia I meet am
E no dey easy unto say FCT dey more or less civil service settlement
Una no fit compare am wit states like Lagos, Kano, Rivers, Edo, Kaduna and odas
Howeva, we dey do Evrithing wey go help improve di achievements wey we record for past
Interestingly, di Federal Capital Territory Administration don stand gidigba for awa back
FCT don placed 16th place on di medals table wey dem just conclude for di 2020 national sports festival
How satisfied you dey wit di performance of athletes
I suppose start my yarn to say na me be di happiest pesin wen di administration of di FCT approve say make we participate for di 2020 national sports festival
Although room still dey for improvement, I go say I dey satisfied wit wetin we achieve
As we dey look back, na we dey always be di 17th, 18th or 19th apart from wen we host sport festival for 2004 and 2018
una know say if una be di host you get advantage wey plenti
una fit patronise as many events as e possible
you fit register as many athletes wey you want
however, wen una dey go out una go cut down di number of events and athletes to minimise cost
I dey happy say dis time around, we no host but e end up for 16th position despite di enormous challenge wey we face
two states, di host Edo and Delta dey battle for supremacy and na dat dey impact negatively for officiating
we suppose perfom better but na officiating wey dey questionable deny us for plenti medals
no be only us be di victims of di supremacy tussle wey dey between Edo and Delta
in all, we dey grateful bikos we do better dan 21 states
wit di support of di goment, we go do better at Delta 2022
di national sports festival don dey open
how una athletes take cope wit dia opponents wey get more experience
the task no dey easy unto say some states don go far as di USA, France and Germany to hire athletes
as e dey for tennis, di player wey win di singles event na from France and dem pay am a sum of N5 million by Delta state
some states don buy so tey 30 proffessional for outside Kontri which be a whole lot money
Remember in adition to goment money, dem get oil companies wey be dem sponsors
For FCT here, na goment funding we depend on solely
one state don give official money wey reach N15m make e go use am monitor proceedings for combat sports
na di money wey some states struggled get to attend the festival
for us, even before we go Benin city, minister don charge us make we dey responsible to ur behaviors and be worthy ambassadors
hin advised say make we no try win by all means
na hin farewell message to us and we abided by it
we no go outside FCT go look for athletes
e don become di policy of di FCT to raise athletes and expose dem for national and international competitions
na dat exact thing we do
Pale una dey hear, abeg give us good pikin afta una don give us good pikin give us money wey we go use take care of dem
se una support calls in some quarters for di National Sports Festival make dem return am wen e suppose dey for amateurs strictly
no throw-way dis golden opportunity
di advantage wey big pass be say e dey make coach lazy
dem dey give coach salary but wen e reach sports festival time dem go give dem money wey dem go use go oda states go poach other athletes
i remember di 2018 edition , dem force some athletes make dem refund as much as N1m on top say dem fail to deliver medal for di states wey give dem contract
true true dis no help in di development of talents
Na so dem eliminate am
Na so dem deny oda players di opportunity wey go exhibit dia talent
Di sports festival don dey for di highest bidder but FCT no go buy medals
We no get money wey we go use take hire athlethes wey go win medals
We go kontinu dey raise local athletes wey be awa own
Pesin wey get God for hin side
True, true we suppose go back to di grassroots
Na 62 wards FCT get
Na evri council area get 10 words except AMAC wey get 12
Sports development suppose start from di ward level
For di past, FCT don organised so many competitions from di ward level but mostly dey team sports like football, handball, volleyball and athletics
Na events wey no dey capital intensive be dis
We dey always start from di wards to di area council headquarters and to di city centre
Na dis be di platform wey dey kontinue to dey generate athletes for di FCT
So i dey call oda states make dem emulate di FCT wen dem wan develop dia own athletes
As we dey tok of developing athletes, you fit tok say enough standard sporting facilities dey FCT?
We get six sports centres wey dey under construction for each of di six area councils
Already, we don make one strong appeal and di hon
Minister of state, Dr Ramatu Tijani Aliyu don already go some of di facilities
She don go Kuje and AMAC and she dey dey plan to go to Bwari an odas go see di level of development
wit di backing of di honourable minister, Alhaji Musa Bello, she dey do Evrithing wey go make sure say dem complete diz facilities
We don also make request for sporting equipments for sports like Karate, Judo, Boxing, Wrestling and a host of odas
Na dey expect favourable responses
Na wetin be di plan for di next edition for di sports festival
We don already start training bikos di next edition no reach one year
We don start preparations and we make requests and recommendations wey go enable us prepare adequately for Delta 2022
We don invariably place di welfare for awa neighbours as awa own dey important
We need to dey imbibe di lessons of Ramadan
Need dey make dem pay more attention to di plights of di poor
Di Muslim month of self-purification and self-denial wey dem also know as Ramadan just end
As e dey last, di season wey dem dey use fast don offer all Muslims opportunity wey dem go use reflect on dia relationship wit Allah
E don also enable those wey get means to share food wit pipo wey poor, wey dey in need and pipo wey be less priviledged
For all Muslims, e be opportunity wey dem go use rededicate demsef to di teachings of di faith and di kos of mankind as a whole
Although e be period of deep reflection on di inter-relationship wey dey between man and hin neighbour, for di oda hand, as well as man and hin God
Even though di long-fasting don go, di lessons must endure
Ramadan get high spritual significance , na one of si five pillars of Islam be dat
To devotees, e be period of self-emptying witout which no spiritual being go get a truly rewarding relationship wit hin maker
Na dat explain why dem mark di exercise for Nigeria (as elsewia in di world) by private and group players, and abstinence from all forms of wordly comforts and pleasures
di aim Na to enhance spiritual growth and foster charity and brodaly love
As di Muslims don mark di end of dis annual spiritual exercise, dem dey hope say make di outkom go be of immense benefit di nation
Naija pipo can hardly make ends meet due to di economic situation wey dey prevail for di Kontri
As we dey pay attention to di plights of di poor, as dem amply demonstate am for di course of Ramadan we dey invariably place di welfare for awa neighbours say e dey important as awa own
As we dey allow odas partake for awa wealth or material possessions, we honour di one wey make us
Na dis be di heart of all religions but a virtue wey dey hard to imbibe by plenti pipo for Naija
E gast change
So tey di Ramadan fast, like di fawa pillars wey dey Islam, dem aim am at promoting both di spiritual and material well-being of man, e stand to reason say man dey invariable beta off s e dey do di will of God
Wen he dey able to rein in di impulse for self-gratification and greedy accumulation of wealth, man dey more liable to make hin society a better place wey pesin go live in, no be only hin but for hin neighbor also
Dat na one of di most enduring lessons of Ramadan wey we hope plenti pipo go imbibe
E dey noteworthy dat fasting as e be spiritual exercise dey advocated by all religions obstenibly wit di notion say di man wey fit make sacrifices for di bid to tame hin desires go be beta person for hinself and di society wey large
As one expert don put am say, besides abstention for food and drinks, fasting dey help di pesin wey dey faithful make e no dey look di provocative, make e no dey hear di mischievous, and make e no dey utter di obscene and make e dey avoid slander and make e no dey think about inflicting injury for odas
Di month of Rahmah (blessing), barakah(mercy)and Magfirah dey upon us
Di blessed month na precious gift from Allah to muslims
But do we know why dis moth dey so special to muslims
Na wetin be di main koko for dis month, and all di blessings wey dey wit it
Na wetin be di lessons wey we suppose take away in observing, di sanctity wey dey dis month
Of course, dis month dey to train us, guide us, and to remind us of how we suppose approach di 11 months of di year wey remain
Ramadan dey teach us plenti lessons: how we go develop awa manners and moral fortitude, how we go treat awa fellow beings wit respect, how we go strenghten awa brodahood , how we go maintain unity wey dey di Muslim community, and how we go dey welkom di non-Muslims wey we dey share land togedir
Di month dey also tech us make we dey more pious, disciplined, and how we go maintain self-control, wen we dey shield awa souls from greed and immorality
But di main koko be say di month dey teach us how we fit improve awa connection wit di Almighty
Di month of Ramadan dey also instill sense of empathy wey dey inside us
E dey allow us to understand di situation of di less fortunate, make we feel and experience di pain of hunger and di pangs of thirst wey awa poverty-stricken brodas and sisters wey no get choice but to go witout food and drinks dey feel everi day wen dem wake
Ramadan na month of mercy and bonding Muslims wey dey all over di world dey help one anoda, and those wey dey dia community, make dem dey spread happiness all around
Dis month na shinny example for di unity wey we fit achieve among all classes of pipo wey dey any society as di rich and di poor, di employer as well as di employee; di parents as well as di subjects, all dey fast
Regardless of di colour wey dem get for skin or dia social stature, na fasting dey unite all

E dey give us opportunity wey we go use rectify awaselves through performing plenti good deeds wey be like providing food or aid to di needy, improving social interaction, giving charity, sadaqah and zakat, and so on
Di Almighty go remember all di deeds wey do for judgement day
But wetin go apun to all di lesson wey we don learn afta Ramadan
Unfortuntely, we no too dey retain any of di lessons wey we learn for dis holy month pass Eid-Il-Fitr itself
But di koko for Ramadan run deep pass mere celebration
Di lessons wey we receive be di lodestar for di rest of di 11 months for any year wey dem give
Di training wey we receive suppose improve us as human beings fo di rest of awa lives, as dat na di main koko of Ramadan
Afta di month don end, and we don observe awa final fast, and dem don deal wit di Eid celebrations, we go go back to awa normal lives
But e dey important make we kip di spirit of Ramadan alive for di rest of di year, and indeed for awa live wey remain
bikos, na only through unity, modesty, and temperance we fit make di world a place wey beta for all of us
As we don tok evri evri, di nation leadres, political and odawise, get plenti wey dem go take from di lessons of Ramadan
If dem fit curtail deir materialistic tendencies and pay more attention to di yearnings fo di pipo , di Kontri go bikom a place much happier for Evribodi
We direfore dey urge awa leaders make dem imbibe lessons for Ramadan
To awa plenti Muslim readers we tok say , Eid Mubarak

Column no 6: who dey check checkpoint for Abuja
E dey go as dem dey tok am say Abuja, wey be di capital for awa dear Naija, dey important
So na me go be di last person wey go complain say security too much
In fact, I go even tok am say e need am more
Checkpoints, wey be di incredibly useful security constructs, don help and e still dey kontinue to help make e either thwart criminal, or even proactively tackle crime
Di police, wey dem saddle wit plenti of di internal security, at least for di ideal situation, man most of di checkpoints for Abuja Metropolis, as well as areas wey dey di surrounding
Sure, di army don pick up di slack for some places, but di boys supose be di main custodians
Dem vex for di pikin say dem do dat kain thing
Boy, dem dey mess things up for plenti cases
For starters, take for instance one of di checkpoints wey dey Wuse II, particularly di one wey dey lead from zone 4 treach Wuse II , just before e reach di bridge
di conduct of di officers for dere, for my experience, dey abysmal
anyone wey ply dat road afta 9pm
I no go enta details, but wetin I fit tok be say e dey extremely unprofessional sometimes
still for Wuse II, just beside di AP Plaza, di Tori na di same
I go lyk suggest to di higher-ups make dem monitor all di checkpoints wey dey Wuse II make dem see wetin I dey tok firsthand
but di checkpoints horror Tori no end for there
probably di one wey worst pass na di checkpoint wey dey afta di popular Banex junction wey dem dey man by cops wey dey from di Counter Terrorismm Unit (CTU) no less
barking at commuters and intimidating innocent citizens evri night, dem cut a picture of a poorly-trained and badly-behaved set of individuals wey seem to miss di point say dem suppose protect and serve citizens
na di same CTU dey responsible for di presonnel manning for one checkpoint wey dey near di Naija Farms And Ranch (NAFARLS), wia all kain tinz dey unfold
anyone wey dey ply dat road fit see for demselves
I go also request make di higher-ups do di same, wit a view wey dem go use fix things
forget Abuja for one minute
look around Naija, and di plenti checkpoints roadblocks, really for highway across di Kontri by numerous security agencies, dem dey see am a reson for loss of time generally, or even for consumer goods and services
as di case be wit awa security organisations, dem dey always push back swiftly, wit well-oiled PR machines wey deny allegations or issuing veiled threats
no forget di fact say while plenti checkpoints fit be legal, plenti are not
dem make am clear by di way and manner in which di personnel mounting dey carry out dia activities
now, dis no be police-bashing piece
E no suppose disparge VIOs and FRSC personnel
E be general critique for checkpoints and how we dey do am for dis part of di world
which means we go look at odas, lyk di Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and dat of VIOs
again, I no go yarn too much, just make I suggest closer monioring of di checkopints and checkpoints, really for some revelation dey shock
dis na bikos dis no be piece wey suppose disparge anyone or any organisation
but generally someone fit do something about di ridiculous lack of quality of awa checkpoints?
checkpoints no be recent, e far as innovations go
dem be set standards for di various stypes wey exist, wetin we need do na to adhere to dem
dem dey quite helpful for fighting crime, we no fit wish dem away
But we owe to awaself to get dem right
like most things dem get di capacity for great good, but if to say dem handle am badly, e fit be source for plenti bad things
maybe if we focus on di one wey dey Abuja go help us, as best practices don dey spread nationwide
I no get interest in highlighting di bad, but di personnel wey dey di checkpoint dey make am inevitable
as all hope neva lost: I dey hope say somehow, someone, somewia wey fit do something about awa checkpoints go do something dem
dat someone, somewia, somehow, dey check awa checkpoints, and di pipo wey dey man dem
e fit make all di difference in awa safety and public perception about awa security personnel,wey be something we dey lack solely for a while now
time neva reach?
we dey do things different-different
put am for rotation
Glut don jam Katsina tomato farmers
Farmers and dealers of tomatoes for Katsina state don experince for di past two weeks acute market glut; some don resort to dey sun-dry di produce
according to di farrmers, dem no dey expect dat kain development, considering di stiff economic condition wey dey di Kontri, high cost and demand for food items, as well as longtime border closure wey halt free importation of food items wey include tomato paste
Shehu Bashiru Danja, wey be tomato farmer yarn say dem dey expect huge revenue for dis period but dem dash deir hope wit di recent development
plenti of us don target christmas and New year period, wit di hope say we go make good sales or di produce, but e shock us say we go end up for market glut
hin tok say e really affect us bikos of di high cost of production wey involve fertiliser, seeds,herbicides/pesticides and labor
Bahiru kom add say since di closure for land borders and di outbreak of COVID-19, di market price for tomato no less pass N1,000 for one basket until recently
hin kom add for last year say dem sell one big basket of tomatoes between N3,000 and N10,00, one reason wey many irrigation farmers dis season go concentrate on tomato production, and dem dey hope say e go yield huge profits pass crops like wheat, irish potato,or cabbage
Hamza Dalhatu, wey be tomato merchant and farmer yarn say dem borne di market glut out of protest against di indiscriminate taxes and levies wey dem put for di produce for Southern market
so tey last year, increase don dey in taxes and levies on awa goods and trucks wey dey di southern part for di Kontri
di security issue wey dey linger be threats to awa merchants; na so dem suspend business till dem sort out things
we no fit kontinue lyk dat
Dalhatu tok say, all di cost burden go end up on farmers wey no go consider di cost of production .
one check for Danja and Funtua market don reveal say one small basket of tomatoes cost N400 wen one big basket no pass N1,200
so tey last week Friday
anoda tomato dealer, Sani Suleiman Hunkuyi, don express hope say things go soon normal as dealers for Lagos and Ibadan don visit some of dia members wey dey Sokoto, Kebbi, and Zamfara make dem fashion out new terms for di business
di market glut for di produce be temporary and farmers go soon kontinue dey reap I maximum benefits for dem sweat
Suleiman tok say/Suleiman yarn say
Also, Umar Isah, wey be an agric based Katsina yarn say market glut no be beta thing to pipo wey dey produce Tomato and Onion, and e go kontinue unless dem produce modern storage and and processing facilities, no be only by di goverment but agricultural companies and entrepreneurs
di only way be say make dem establish local storage and processing facilities wey dem go use produce zone across di Kontri
hin yarn say, make agric companies and entrepreneurs take dis challenge as soon as possible take use solve di long time problem
Nana na di last pesin wey commot di room

Sergeant Adegoke Ajibola and Corporal Rotimi Oladele run as fast as deir legs fit carry,seek for place wey dem go hide, pleaded for deir lives as di mob close on dem
all dia pleas go fall on deaf ears
dem drag dem, beat dem, hit dem wit sticks, knives and any objects wey dey available for sight
for di time wey dem still dey beg make dem spare dia lives, dem set dem for fire for one heap of tyres
as di fire dey rage , dia voice lost for di flames, wey dem no go eva hear dem for for life
di two men wey dem burn to death for Iwo Road for di ancient town fo Ibadan , wey be di largest city for Naija, no be criminals

according to di official record and findings by awa correspondence,Ajibola and Oladele no be members of di SARS wey dem just disband
in fact dem no be regular policemen wey dem dey see for road as finding don reveal say dem dey attached to di operation department for Oyo state police command
di area wey dem dey engage dey usually be for special duty as different companies and organisations de request, and as e dey approved by di command
dem dey dia way for dat engagement for one fish depot for di Wema Bank area wey dey Gbagi for Ibadan wen dem meet dia untimely death
coincidentally, Ajibola wey be 41 year-old and hin colleague,Oladele, get three pikin each
Oladele's wife, Feranmi,just born dia third pikin 16 days before di unfortunate incident
Feranmi, wey be di orphan, just as her husband wey late, tok say di news of hin death shattered her world

Abiodun Alade and Eugene Agha for Lagos, Jeremiah Oke for Ibadan and Idowu Samotu for Abuja
Explosion dey for around dat ikeja and e kill some pipo
Dem dey develop Naija's gas for di domestic market
di natural gas na one cultured industry wey dey drive innovation and e dey touch nearly Evri field and aspect of life wey we care about
from mobile phones to di makeup wey we dey wear, to medical devices, bank cards, and even di football wey e dey kick around wit friends
Di industry na one of di building blocks of di things wey we need and love evri day
dem dey use natural gas for transportation, cooking, electricity generation and manufacturing
Dem dey use am as raw material wey dem dey use make ferterlizer,antifreeze, plastics, pharmaceuticals and fabrics
Di steel and paper industry dey also us e natural gas to generate process steam wey dem dey use for industrial applications
Data wey dey for ground don show say Africa's largest economy, Naija, get di largest natural gas reserves for di continent
wit oil, di industry go account for about 70 per cent of its revenue, e go make di sector one of Naija's best and most sought-afta employment sectors
plenti of Naija's electricity generation na from natural gas, while dem dey use di crude oil for power backup
one forecast wey di U.S Energy Information Administration do don show say dat natural gas go be di largest elcetricity generation source
Natural- gas dem bring its sevaral quality- of-life environmental benefits bikos e dey relatively clean burning-fuel
Globally, di sector dey dey produce millions of jobs, ,wit employment wey dey up to 40 per cent so tey di Great Reccession of 008 for di U.S alone
Thus, given di gas reserves wey dey exist, e shock to see say Naija no dey lead di continent gas industry
President Buhari don launch di kontri's decade of gas, for 29th of March 2021
Di aim na to transform Naija into a gas-powered industrialised economy by 2030
Developing di gas industry go boost oda industries through di provsion of electricity and raw materials
Here, we go shine light on three points: some gas development policies wey dey critical, di potential benefits of developing di gas industry for di domestic market , and di employent opportunities wey dey gas industry
So tey di discovery of gas for Naija, subsequent attempts to develop di industry
For example, di gas commercialisation and utilisation programmes contributed to reduce gas flaring and increase gas utilisation by about 300 per cent between 1995 and 2017
there be gas pipeline projects wey concentrate on di western part of di kontri and di continent
Dem commissioned di first Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System for 1989 to supply lagos and neighboring south-west states
Afta di success of di ELPS, di goverment agree make dem dey supply Ghana, Benin and Togo through di Western African Gas Pipeline wey dem commission for 2016
Howeva, dis project no dey favourable to di kontri's domestic market, given di persistent issues for power wey dey di kontri
Evidently, Naija's power sector dey challenged wit electricity facilities wey poor, shortage for natural gas supply, distribution network wey dey inefficient and transmission system wey dey inadequate
Accordig to di 2018 estimate wey di International Energy Agency do, na only 60 per cent of Naija dey use natural gas
population get access to electricity
power shortage don limit di growth for di Kontri's total population for all sectors
E don kos make plenti business close or move completely to neighboring kontries
E dey challenge new start-ups and attract foreign investment
Di lack of electricity don contribute to di high rate of inflation as business don dey pay for expensive alternative electricity source, dia production cost don increase, and e dey increase di price of goods and services
To mitigate diz issue, di Buhari administration don commision gas infrastructure project make dem promote use of gas for domestic market
Di projects include di second Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS-2) Obiafu Obriko
Oben (OB3) gas line and di Ajaokuta to Kaduna to Kano (AKK) gas line
Di AKK gas line project go pass through Abuja from Ajaokuta
Den we go see anoda line from Abuja to Kaduna,, den from Kaduna to Zaria, and from Zaria to Kano
wit hindight, dem suppose do dis projects since di turn of di millenium
Nonetheless, dem be notable projects and dem suppose praise dem wit optimism
Dem expect make di project guarantee net investment return
Di gas line go provide gas to cement firms, and residential customers
Di users of compressed natural gas like buses and trucks go dey able to buy di product cheaper as di supply don increase
Di governmet dey also plan to build three new gas-fired power plants for power generation plants wey dem fit locate for Abuja, Kaduna, and Kano, make dem use di pipelines gas to generate 3,600 MW power
Di power plant go provide electricity for households and many industries wey dey di Northern part of di kontri
Di benefit for producing a decent amount of power and raw materials from gas go born one success tori
For example, if dem resuscitate di textile industry e go mean say dem dey revive di largest manufacturing sub-sector, wey account for 22 per cent of employment and 15 per cent of manufacturing value-added for 1984
in di long run, di tax revenue for di performing industries and employees go outweigh di cost of pipeline projects
If to say goverment policies dey successful, all oda things as e dey equal, di natural gas industry go be one major source of job opportunities for Naija's labour force wey dey rise
Di industry get high concentration of contractors and sub-contractors, wit different splits wey dey between specialists
Dem characterise di industry as semi-skiled and skiled crafts trades positions
Demmno restrict jobs wey dey di sector to petrolrum engineers alone
plenti roles no need special education
Di skil na something e fit learn on di job, from attorneys to welders to architects, truck drivers and accountants
Di industry dey also pay minimum wage
E mean say di industry get enormous opprtunity to attract, retain, and developlifelong careers for individuals as di industry dey expand
To dey find job for di industry dey similar to oda sophisticated, high-tech industries
Employees suppose get decent education, some certification as industry specialist go be an advantage, training and experince go go far
therefore, as di goverment dey lay out policies for di Decade of Gas,, di opportunity for capacity development go open
Di education sector fit explore di training curriculum wey dey for di industry and ways wey dem go take use attract industry experts wey go contribute to capacity development
In conclusion, di decade for Gas na desirable policy
E be opportunity for Naija wey dem go use to develop di gas industry, even as e dey look a bit too late for dis administration
Thus, di goment wey next and all di relevant stakeholders suppose consider dis ingenuity wey dem go use transform di kontri to a gas-powered industrialised economy

As di demand for rabbit don dey increase, frmers dey explain say make di youths key in for dis kain of farming
Rabbit farming no common for Naija but di demand for rabbit meat dey grow as e be for kontries like Europe and Asia
Acoording to wetin di Food and Agriculture Organisation of di United Nations (FAO) don estimate say dem dey slaughter 1.2 billion rabbits annually for meat
Di South African National Agricultural Marketing Council for June 2020 don reveal say 1.48 million tons of rabbit meat were produced in 2017.
China wey be di leading producer dey acount for 62.9% of di production wey dey global, followed by followed by North Korea (10.4%), Spain (3.9%) and Egypt (3.8%), among odas
As 2019 dey end, Hungary, China, France and Spain dey among di major contributors to di trade balance for rabbit meat by value globally
According to wetin statistic say .Germany, Belgium and Italy na di leading importers as dem dey command 21%, 19.2% and 9.3% share of global imports respectively
For Naija here, one far, Wise Trust Intl Ltd dey change di narrative amidst huge and rising demand for rabbit meat and breeding stock for di kontri
Pastor Tayo Ayinla wey white meat dey drive hin passion tok am say hin first motivation for di rabbit business na di health benefit bikos pipo wey dey hin age suppose cut down di consumption of red meat and waka dey chop white meat hin kom add say di motivation further led to di discovery of its economic benefits.
Na di pastor get di biggest rabbit farm for di Federal Capital Territory
Hin get 17 species of rabbit on top di farm wey hin start like say a year ago for Karshi, for Abuja Municipal Area Council.
Hin dey raise dem for cage, hutches wey dem construct locally and in free range
Dis reporter wey dey Karshi, visit di farm wia di pastor kom share hin knowledge of rabbit farming so odas fit tap into am
Hin also get rabbits for anoda farm for Kwara state
Some of di free range rabbit for di farm
How rabbits dey multiply
Hin say if di farmer get about 60 to 70 doe ( na di female rabbit dem dey call doe and di male buck) wit an average of five births per rabbit, hin go get very good number per year.
For instance, on dis farm, we don see a doe wey born 10 to 11 rabbits
But I wan dey more conservative
So make we say five rabbits as an average: di one rabbit fit give farmer between 25 to 30 rabbits for a year bikos wen good management dey dem fit produce four to six times for one year
So if to say hin get five for one year dat mean say hin get 25
Multiply am by di 60 wey we dey tok about e make 1,600 rabbits for one year
Of kos, una fit get pass dat
pipo dey demand for rabbit meat
Di demand for rabbit meat dey grow and according to wetin Pastor Ayinla say, dem neva meet di demand fully
Hin tell di reporter say hin receive order of 10 tons of rabbit meat for di Southwest but e dey very difficult to get even one ton
At some time una go get perosn wey go dey request for 2,500 rabbits say hin wan breed am but hin go get up 500
One time dey wey we get request of 2,500 rabbits for breeding stock for di whole of di North (di client organisation get Northern representative for Abuja here), but for di whole of di North, we dey only supply a little above 200 out of di order wey dem place for 2,500.
So rabbitry na upkoming ATM moni dispenser
Hin say very soon e go turn moni dispencing business
Di rabbit value chain don boom
Di farmer explain for di rabbit value chain say : most of us no know di benefits wey we get for rabbit rearing
Number one be say, plenti value dey for rabbit farming
As a farmer una fit make moni from selling di rabbits breding stock to anoda farmer; una fit sell rabbit meat to those wey want am; una fit get income through di sale of dia poo or from di conversion of dia poo into gas for cooking, or generation of electricity and wetin remain of dat process fit be used as fertiliser.
Most pipo dey use rabbit wastes for fertiliser but e no dey as effective as wen una dey pass di poo for some process
Also, dem fit use di urine as pesticide for di production of vegetables
Cost wey dem dey take use start rabbit farm no dey expensive
wit just N25,000 to N30,000 farmer fit start rabbit farming
Di good thing be say anybodi fit do am; an old person fit do am bikos of di management dey very easy
Una no need one particular place to do rabbit farming bikos dem be neat animals, dem no dey smell
Actually una fit do am for una house even for person wey get two-bedroom flat
For instance, una fit convert one of di room
Dem no dey smell
Di farmers dey always kom buy from us; we dey assist dem set up dia farms
And as I tok am, for awa own little way, we start am about a year ago
Rabbit feed no dey expensive
Di thing wey good about rabbits be say dia feeding no dey demand, dem just dey chop anything
For instance, as we dey handle am here, we dey usually go meet pipo wey dey sell cabbage and collect di outer cover of di cabbage, e dey okay for dem
Also for di person wey dey sell watermelons, pipo dey usually chop di red part throw-way di cover
Di cover dey medicinal to dem
Also, we dey go market wey dem dey sell carrots go pick di leaves
Virtually wetin rabbit dey chop na almost free, and e dey get much easier
wen di rain start den we fit get plenti fresh leaves for dem
One word for di youths be say make dem work hard
My advice for di youths be say make dem understand say di goverment no fit meet all of awa needs
Di reason why we dey get some kain kwanta be say plenti pipo want make goverment jobs
First and foremost, una need look inward: wetin I fit do for myself
Until una fit do something for unaself una no fit do anything for di kontri
Una suppose understand say lots of opportunity dey as dis kontri is concerned
Some pipo go tell you say dem wan do dis and dat
Egun pipo speak beta pass una
But market no dey
So di question na: how una go dey kontri wey get pass 200 million pipo kom dey tok say money no dey
Una dey tok say market no dey
Na either una no understand how dem dey market wetin una dey do
Abi una no know how dem dey do business
Like for rabbit, if una see how awa rabbits be, di business go attract you, dem dey look so robust
So pipo dey say I neva see rabbit wey big like dis
Dis na di way we dey take use manage dem in terms of wetin we feed dem and di environment wey we create for dem
So pipo go begin dey look inwards
Una fit sell rabbit meat to those wey want am; una fit get income through di sale of dia poo or from di conversion of dia poo into gas wey dem dey use cook or generate electricity and wetin dey ground of dat left of di process wey dem fit use as fertiliser
Na only e-voting go ensure rancour say free polls dey for Naija- Diri
Senator Duoye Diri wey be di Bayelsa state governor tok say di hitch-free conduct of di Ijaw National Congress (INC) election wey dem do through electronic voting don indicate say Naija fit hold rancour-free national elections if dem adopt dat kain measure
Diri don tok am for di inauguration of di new INC leadership at di Ijaw house for Yenagoa, as hin urge di Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) make dem adopt electronic voting wey go help dem avoid conflicts during elections.
Hin note am say di failure of di electoral bodi of di kontri make dem adopt e-voting don lead to politicisation of reversed state institutions and disrespect to such institutions.
Di governor don explain say di adoption go provide opportunity for Naija pipo wey dey di Diaspora choose dia leaders through di ballot.
Hin say: I be advocate and supporter of electronic voting system
Dem don deny plenti Naija pipo di right wey go make dem vote bikos dem no dey Naija and dem no fit participate in choosing dia leaders
Na challenge for Naija e be
Make e challenge di Independent National Electoral Commission
If di Ijaws fit do am, di Federal goverment fit do am also
If Ijaws fit enfranchise Ijaws wey dey Europe and America make dem be part of deciding who go lead dem, INEC fit do am
Hin tok say e go check violence, criminality and state institutions being politicised
For hin inaugural lecture, di new INEC president, Professor Benjamin Okaba asuure dem say di bodi go work for di progress of Ijaw pople
Prof. Okaba note am say INEC go fully support di recent pronouncement by governors of south Naija wey dey prohibit open grazing for di region, hin still tok say di organisation go provide necessary support wey go ensure say dem adhere to di laws wey dem aim at protecting di pipo and dia land against invasion from external forces.
Hin say di INC go collaborate wit oda ethnic minorities wey dey share di same experience wit di Ijaws make dem achieve dia dreams, say di ethnic group no dey aware of surreptitious moves wey some groups dey make to annex territories for di Niger Delta so tey di resources wey e get, but say no part of Ijaw would be ceded or conquered.
Jide like to dey do yanga wen hin don get new toy

Di pikin get kro-kro/craw-craw for bodi
Di communique also tok am say di two layers of goverment and di central bank of Naija suppose put in dia best measures wey go help avert food scarcity, especially scarcity of maize for 2021 as most maize farmers for Naija don lose dia crops to di drought.

awa governor for Oyo state don show unparalleled love for farmers for Oyo state and we fit see say hin wan make agriculture be di major pillar wey go promote di economy for di state
Alabi plead say we dey halla on hin make hin extend di funding of di loan for farm settlement to us for Oke-Ogun

We need understand say Nigeria na di pipo wey dey inside.
So, wen we belittle di kontri, we just dey shoot awasef for leg.
If we tok say Nigeria na scam, indirectly wetin we mean be say, Nigerians be scammers.
Nigeria no be scam, like som of dose wey dey abuse di nation dey always tok, unknowingly; Na we turn Nigeria to anytin wey e be.
Nigeria no be just a place somwia.
Nigeria na di pipo.
Di gud, di bad and di ugly “ na we make am be laidat.
Anytin wey dey affect di kontri, na we be di agent wey cause am.
If Nigeria na scam as Pastor Paul Adefarasin tok, den we all be scammers.
Even say I agree, say Adefarasin anger na becos of di love wey e get for di kontri, im comment say Nigeria na scam and fraud no dey reasonable. 
If Nigeria na fraud; den all of us be fraudster, leaders and followers join.
All of us don contribute to di dissapointment of di entity.
We dey live for a kontri wia pastors dey run dia ministry like business.
Dem dey run am like business enterprise but dem no dey pay tax for dere.
CAMA; Government introduce a law wey go regulate di business undertaking of di religious industry and wey go bring som transparency and accountability inside di spiritual business.
But na pastors dey against dis law pass.
Still, na dis same pipo wey no wan follow di law be di loudest voice wen dem dey pass capital sentence on Nigeria.
Funny tin be say, dis pastors dey follow di law of oda kontri dey run dia church for dose kontri.
Dem dey submit dia finance for regular check by di authorities for UK, US and oda places.
But for Nigeria dem dey live above di law.
Pastor Chris Oyakhilome don dey spread harmful lies about COVID vaccine.
E claim say na di concoction of di anti-Christ.
Dem fine am 125,000 pounds for Uk, sake of say e dey tok harmful and unsubstantiated tins about di vaccine.
But for Nigeria wia e dey kontinue to bring different COVID conspiracy, dem neva call am to kom explain im offence, sake of say na man of god e be. 
Maybe na why Nigeria be scam.
If Nigeria na scam, den na becos of pastors wey dey siddun for top, kom dey step on di law wey dey govern di land.
If Nigeria na fraud, den na becos of pastors wey dey sign agreement wit politicians everi election period; dey campaign for dem on di altar, dey command di demons of hell untop dose wey no gree accept dia anointed candidate.
Clergymen dey as corrupt as di politikal class.
Also, civil servant, wey dey collect N150,000 per month, but get pikin for UK school, and property for all ova di major cities of di kontri, go abuse Nigeria and carry all im hypocrisy put for lamentation and insult to di state.
E go calm down ignore e own contribution for di corruption wey dey destroy di kontri.
Also, som citizens dey reject laws, rules and regulations.
Wia traffic light dey, dem go ignore am; wia protocol dey, dem go bypass am, and for places wia dem don get standard for gud service delivery and operations, dem go abandon am.
Still, all of dem go blame Nigeria for di bad status quo as if say di kontri dey exist witout di pipo.
Di problem wey Nigeria get na pipo problem.
But di bad tin be say nobodi wan take responsibility for di terrible way wey tins be.
We dey blame di Nigeria wey no exist.
Na all of us get hand for inside di bad situation of Nigeria.
Instead make we dey follow di tin wey we don conclude about Nigeria, make we forsee goodness and positivity into di system, and make we dey work to make awa kontri di tin wey we want make e be.
Nigeria go be wetin we want make e be.
Di politicians get comma.
But dat na di reason why new generation of leaders must come up and take kontrol.
Nobodi fit free awa mind except us.
Citizenship na call to duty.
NIGERIA NO BE SCAM.
Why separation no be di Silver Bullet to Nigeria challenges
Di principle of self-determination as e dey for di UN charter wey awa pipo wey wan separate hold-on to, take effect for a time wey many pipo for di world dey under colonial yoke or oda form of kontrol by outside power.
Di principle na to give chance to independence and liberation movements so dem go fit gain dia freedom and determine dia path of future development.
For di world wey we dey today, dis principle only apply to few pipo, becos majority of di world don dey free from colonial kontrol and sef-governing.
So dem go need adjust di principle of sef-determination, wey dem establish under di UN charter, so e go fit accommodate di demand of awa pipo wey wan separate, becos if we follow wetin dey dere, dem no qualify.
First of all, dem go need to prove carefully and convincingly say di area wey dem claim to represent dey under som form of kontrol, and say dem dey lack di basic freedom wey everibodi suppose enjoy as e dey di UN charter.
And for wia dem wan prove dat one, dem go need convince di UN on di steps wey dem don take, from di national (National Assembly), sub-regional (ECOWAS) and continental level (AU) to present dia case.
And di UN no go just take dia word laidat.
Dem go get committee wey go confam di fact to know weda true-true, Nigeria as a kontri dey practise di basic requirement of demokracy or not.
Dem don even complicate di case wit di fact say dose areas no be area wey dem dey fight untop, and no be area wey dey under any trusteeship wey go need UN referendum to give dem direct independence or ask dem who dem wan join inside di pipo wey dey fight untop di place. 
If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements, the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities.
E no dey give chance make som movement wey no know wetin dem dey about abuse im wide and transparent process. 
Di case of marginalisation, wey dem mention as part of di reason for separation, dey too simple to waste awa time untop.
Na everi democratik system dey get winner and loser for election.
And as awa politikal system no perfect reach, di konstitution make am compulsory say as many ethnic group and geo-political zones as possible must get representative for government and im institutions.
E go tough for di pipo wey wan separate to convince di outside world say dia case of marginalisation dey more compelling pass dat of more dan 300 oda ethnic group wey dey Nigeria.
Wetin dis one mean be say, why di international community, wey di pipo wey wan separate dey report and seek support from go single out jus two out of like hundred of dat kind case wey dey ring for di Nigerian media say na im dem go work on ?
What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession?
Out of all di three tins wey make awa secessionists dey agitate, no one dey convincing or compelling enough to justify dia action.
On di amalgamation argument, Nigeria own no be special case for Afrika or for di world.
If Nigeria go need break up unto say Britain no join am well, den dis go be di case of almost all di kontris for Afrika.
In short, if dem use dis principle, e go start di course to begin a new scramble for Africa by di old and upcoming world powers, and like befor, na Afrikans go be di victim.
Make we no deceive awasef, becos if di break-up of Nigeria happun (God forbid), e go lead to di birth of kontris
wey go dey weak sotey, dem go dey beg from di foreign powers.
We don get som argument wey dey compare di break up of Nigeria wit dat of Eastern European states and di Balkans.
Untop dis one, e go beta make we undastand well say di tin wey work for Europe fit no work for Africa.
In di case of di kontris wey we mention, na part of di great geo-strategic games of di major world powers wey get direct cultural, economik and politikal link and interest for di emerging scenario.
And dis kontris don get clear boundary befor dem agree to kom togeda for mutual defence durin di uncertain situation of di Second World War.
Immediately di Soviet order, wey join dem togeda begin dey scatter, all dis kontris need go back to di status quo ante.
And, more importantly, dis developments get di backing and guarantee of di important powers for Europe and di world.
Se Nigerian secessionists get dat kind recognition and profile in di face of di principal powers of di world wey go make dem answer dem?
Surely, di answer na zero.
Dis no kom mean say di agitation of pipo to separate for di kontri no get som gud reason.
Anybodi wey dey live for dis kontri wit dis rising case of insecurity, poverty, corruption, nepotism, economic uncertainty and di unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of di government to dis challenges go conclude say truly, we dey for a kontri wey dey fail for im basic konstitutional duties and responsibilities.
And for a fragile kontri like awa own, wey get plenti fault, e dey normal for tendency or preference for separation to arise and grow fast wit di clear dysfunctionality of di government wey dey.
And na everybodi get dis dis feeling.
But as discouragin as di outlook be, and as temptin as di outcome dey appear, separation no fit be di solution to awa current challenge as a nation.
Indeed na prospect wey get som unknown dangers, danger wey no be for di secessionists alone but for di kontri as a whole.
Nigeria no dey perfect.
Even som of di advance kontris don show say despite dia years of existence and dia gud systems, dem no dey free from crises wey dey kom from internal conflict.
Make we no dey deceive awasef say as we dey try break up awa kontri, som kontris go graciously assist us.
Wetin dem go do na to give us di means to destroy and weaken awasef, so dem go fit benefit while we go suffer am. 
Na di truth about di international system be dat.
As di popular German beamter tok for di beginnin of my paper; Na we be awa own problem and solution join togeda.
We need put awa mind, talent and effort togeda to develop Nigeria instead say we wan breaking am.
Fidelity celebrate Children Day wit N9.3m money gift to dia customers

Investin in young pipo: Ahmed Bobboi example
For July, 2017, I get di honour to spend one evenin inside one British bank wey dem dey call Coutts, as part of di plenti activity wey dey for us as di 2017 Queen's Young Leaders.
U fit dey wonder say why I go dey write about event wey I go for place wey dry like bank.
Anyway, Coutts no be ordinary bank.
Apart from say na one of di eight oldest bank for di world (dem start am som 329 years ago for 1692), Coutts na private bank wey dey popular for im big customers like Her Majesty di Queen.
Inside di big hall, na two welcome us under a big dome for di centre of di building.
Na sharp-sharp I recognise one of di two men wey stand wit a familiar wide smile.
Na Sir John Major, befor-befor British Prime Minister and Chairman of di Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust.
We don meet befor, for one dinner wey dem organize for us for di Australian High Commission wey dey London, and na dere e congratulate us for awa recognition by Her Majesty.
Dem introduce di oda man to us as Lord William Waldegrave of North Hill. Na im be di Chairman of di Board of Coutts Bank and Chairman of di Royal Mint Advisory Committee.
Dat evening dey full of entertainment; eatin and drinkin. E sweet well-well
But apart from di display and glamour, we tok and gist wit Lord Waldegarve and Sir Major, two outstandin leaders for di United Kingdom (UK).
Dem show dia happiness to celebrate awa achievement, and dem describe us as special pipo. Dem encourage us to develop awa skills more and create long legacy for awa kontri and di Commonwealth togeda.
Afta, I follow Sir Major and Lord Wadegrave yarn for private, I ask dem som question about public service, banking and finance, innovation and young pipo generally.
I learn a lot of tins from dem
and I komot for Coutts.
Dat night seriously inspire and motivate me more as a change agent, innovator and young leader for Nigeria.
Weda u dey for government, or u dey business, and especially as innovator or entrepreneur, I no fit tok am finish, how important dis kind inspiration fit be for di work wey u dey do.
Som pipo fit komot face for dis confirmation say e no dey relevant. Dem don forget how dis kind tok fit be beta way of mentorship and motivation for upcomin leaders, and e fit serve as example for dem to see champions among pipo wey be like dem.
Di feeling of validation and motivation, wit guidance and support na necessary ingredient for everi leader, especially young pipo.
Di earlier awa older generation for Nigeria realise and accept dis culture of support and mentorship wit dia full chest, and truly celebrate awa achievements, di beta e go be for di future of dis kontri and di growin population of young pipo.
Make u forgive my digression.
Di reason why I dey narrate dis experience na say, since wey e don happun, I no experience dat kind tin again, until recently wen I siddun wit anoda public servant for Nigeria, di Executive Secretary of di Petroleum Equalisation Fund
(Management) Board (PEF-M-B), Alhaji Ahmed A Bobboi.
Even say oil and gas no be my main industry of discipline or practice, I get strong opinion say make pesin no sabi am dey very careless since di contribution of di sector to revenue
pass any oda sector for di kontri.
So I don dey try sabi wetin dey happun for di industry, even say I want make we shift and focus on non-oil sources of income.
I dey happy say I get di opportunity to yarn wit a crucial stakeholder like di executive, especially becos di organisation na pacesetter for di use of advance technology to improve efficiency and performance for di sector.
Howeva, wetin I gain from dis experience even dey more valuable pass my understanding of di industry more.
We discuss difrent topic; from history to government, and from job creation to innovation and entrepreneurship.
E dey very excitin and refreshin, and e carry me straight go Coutts again.
I meet Mr Bobboi for di first time wen I join one team wey e follow kontrol, we dey work untop one regional entrepreneurship acceleration programme under di supervision of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) wia different community for di world join MIT for evidence-based practical approach to make di entrepreneurial ecosystems strongthroughinnovation.
I dey suprised by di vision and dedication wey dis go bring for PEF-M-B to dey involve for dis project, as e surely dey visionary and more beneficial to help build a formidable entrepreneurial ecosystem wit partner like MIT pass di ordinary Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme wey most organization dey do, wey no dey get impact most times. 
For dat particular encounter wey I get wit am, we yarn about awa two-years programme wit MIT and di big responsibility of truly acceleratin entrepreneurial development as remedy to lack of jobs and catalyst for prosperity.
The He spoke about various pain points for him as a leader and the approach to solve them.
One of di wonderful takeaway wey I collect na im idea about di National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and how we fit use am serve young graduates and di nation beta.
Becos e don dey notice say som corps members wey dey serve for PEF-M-B dey always dey idle, di executive secretary tok say e don dey find way to ensure say di corp members no just dey engaged, but say dem komot wit skills and knowledge wey go last, and wey go give dem career wey pass government job.
Part of dis go be to do one big programme wey go turn dem to entrepreneurs wey get passion for innovation,througha dedicated and well planned innovation and enterprise trainin durin dia service year for PEF-MB.
Di honesty and sincere disposition of Mr. Bobboi dey visible and penetrating truout awa discussion and me sef kom get di strong will to do my best, no be only to kontinue dey innovate for different sector but to also dey ensure kontinuity for di inspiration and support of younger leaders and innovators, wey go fit make all di difference for awa dear kontri Nigeria.

For oda match wey dem play yestaday, Spartans Spikers of Yola lose 2-3 (21-25, 22-25, 25-17, 25-21, 12-15) to Kwara United, Katsina United flog Caliphate Spikers of Sokoto 3-1 (25-23, 25-19, 22-25, 25-12) while Kada Kings scatter Equity Spikers of Kebbi 3-0 (25-14, 25-15, 25-14).
Wetin Kano need for 2023
Kano need create new path to development for 2023.
Dis na becos di state don dey enta di pit of poverty.
Awa rich pre-colonial history show say na Kano rich pass for all di Hausa states, becos di state dey involve for di economy.
Even say di colonialists destroy di economic foundation of Kano and oda society wey dem colonise, di policy of di pipo wey lead di Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contribute to make Kano remain as di leadin economic centre of Northern Nigeria.
For example, dem establish di first modern water treatment plant wey dey di region for 1931, di first independent power plant for Northern Nigeria, wey get 15MW, and for more dan 80 years, dem neva establish any one wey resemble am for Northern Nigeria.
Dem establish di first industrial estate wey dey di Northern Region, dem inherit only one primary school for 1926, and for 1963 everi village don get primary school (more dan hundred), dem establish secondary schools, dem no meet any hospital (except one dispensary) and for 1963 dem don build two general hospital and more dan hundred dispensaries for everi village.
Na dem lay di foundation of modern Kano.
Politikally, na dem make di NPC becom di rulin party for Nigeria.
From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999, Kano still maintain im position as di second to Lagos.
Kano no get kontrol ova macro-economic policy but e leaders fit provide di right environment for economic growth.
For example, di Dawanau Market, wey still be di biggest grain market for West Africa, e dey bring pipo from all part of di kontinent, even from far place like Gabon and Congo.
All dis na result of di foresight wey Alhaji Bashari Garko (may Allah bless im soul), wey establish di market get.
Di three administration wey don rule Kano from 1999 till today, fit claim say all of dem be di best tin wey don happun to Kano, but why Kano don reduce to numba nine for Nigeria?
One single project no dey wey don bring correct economic change for Kano, even afta plenti effort of consign pipo.
If di elite dey focus and determine, wit state leadership as e dey for di pre-colonial period, Kano no go go down to numba nine for Nigeria wit GDP of $13.30b afta Lagos ($46.03b), Rivers ($32.14b), Delta ($25.48b), Oyo ($21.64b), Imo ($20.64), Edo ($17.50b), Akwa Ibom ($15.26) and Ogun ($13.82).
If we no prevent am now, we no go fit imagine di disaster wey go kom in di next 10 years.
Dis na becos of many reasons. One of dem be say we get more dan four million pupils for public basic schools (primary and JSS) and by 2033 dem go don finish secondary education.
Assume say na onli 10 percent of dem (400,000) go go higher-level, di government go fit sponsor dia education?
Afta dem complete higher education, di economy go fit give dem beta employment?
As e be so, e no fit.
Dis na becos, more dan 250 medical doctors and more dan 1000 nurses wey di state government dey sponsor, na im dem no fit employ.
We go dey deceive awasef wit di skills acquisition programme wey dey train artisans wey no go get any job afta dem learn di skills, sake of say di local economy no fit employ dem.
Everi day we dey hear billions wey federal government allocate for one economic programme or di oda, and still, we no dey reason pass to train plumbers, carpenters, mechanics etc.
Since, awa idea no dey about how we go use resources employ di large population as Gajimasu (1095-1135) do wen e begin di city walls.
We need tink outside di box.
Kano no need genius wey get di best qualification and experience, or saint as di next governor.
Dis na becos di governors wey dey for di last 20 years get som of di best quality, and dem fit even don do dia best, but as all of us dey see, di result no be di best for di state.
So, we need reason outside di box.
Di two parties, APC and PDP no fit provide di kind leadership wey we want, sake of say na godfathers dey kontrol dem, and dem no get idea on wetin to do, but dia main focus na how to share di state resources.
Di best tin wey dem fit do na to negotiate for governor wey go serve di interest of a godfather or cabal.
So, di two parties no be di best option.
Beta pesin fit kom outside on e own, or wit di help of oda beta patriotic pipo.
E fit use any way win, even if e negotiate wit any of di two parties or anoda party sef.
E dey possible
E  don happun befor.
One example wey dey near us na Nasir Elrufai for Kaduna State.
Im be one of di best for im generation, but di security situation for di state don pass im power, sake of say e dey depend on im personal intelligence and capacity.
Pesin wey beta pass am for Kano no go make di place beta unless dem change som important tins. 
I no claim say I get all di answer or even say na me get all di idea wey dey down.
Som of dem na part of Aminu Kano idea.
Plenti beta idea dey for di mind of more intelligent pipo. 
Di idea wey I dey suggest na base on my small experience as labourer of politicians and som trainin wey I get outside dis kontri.
Right now, Kano dey crossroad, and dis ideas fit dey useful.
Som pipo need kom togeda to organise one political movement wey no dey in kontrol of anybodi but pipo wey wan sacrifice.
Make dem look di suggestion below:
Need dey for us to start political organisation at di lowest level and make sure say na di members dey in kontrol.
Material reward no go dey, but sacrifice.
Dis dey possible wit mobilisation and di right message.
Befor di election, di movement or party need take detail inventory of di state and design comprehensive action plan wit specific targets wey dey measurable .
Operational guidelines go dey for all appointees plus di governor, and dem go need announce am so every citizen go fit know and challenge, if dem no follow am.
Anybodi wey dey find position inside di movement or party, go begin from di lowest level to di highest.
Som pipo go argue say dis strategy go kill ambition.
Wetin we need now no be ambition but sustainable system wey dey in kontrol of di pipo.
Also, make dem no give anybodi any position unless e don fulfil som basic condition of competence and honesty, and e go bring reference and guarantor.
All public officers must declare dia asset publicly, and dia family members own join, immediately dem reach office. And forensic experts go need verify everytin .
From time to time, di public need dey know dia salary and expenses (plus travel, entertainment etc).
Anybodi wey becom governor or reach any position no go ever do tins on e own. 
Di governor no go ever
Make appointment alone.
Criteria, go dey, dem go need set expectation or target for dose kind appointment, and dem go need dey assess and evaluate am from time to time. 
All contract wey dem go award go dey fair and transparent, and expert inside and outside di government bureaucracy must evaluate am.
Allocation of plots must dey transparent too.
No governor go get total kontrol of di treasury and na competent staff go dey in charge .
Di governor go be di leader wey go guide all di institution to develop and end one-man rule.
If di governor dey free from dis prison of power, e go lead di state to greatness.
E go lead by example and corruption go reduce becos dem don block all di way wey e fit use abuse power.
Governor suppose dey to supervise public servants and make sure say everybodi do im duty well.
E suppose inspire im pipo wit good lifestyle, commitment to service and transparency.

Pipo get fear say di shutdown wey affect di transport, finance and power sector fit affect di robust economy of di state, wey we feel say e dey part of di top performers for Nigeria.

Arteta must deliver next season
As I don mention befor, Arsenal no get am for mind to sack Mikel Arteta and di club management go back am to turn di Gunners around next season.
Nobodi dey sure if Arsenal don take di right decision, but di club dey plan bring more talented players dis summer.
Pipo dey ask serious questions about di manager ability, and even e own dressin room players dey look am dey wonder if na im be di right man for di job.
For 39 years, Arteta get reputation, wey e build wit Pep Guardiola, as a brilliant coach.
But, afta seventeen months wey e don dey in charge, di fortune of Arsenal neva improve and plenti pipo go argue say di performance of di team dey low pass wen Unai Emery, di man wey e replace, wey knock am out of Europa League dey dia.
Arteta na captain for Arsenal befor and di fans welcome am as dia new champion. But dem don dey lose patience and dem dey agitated as dem see sayChelsea and Tottenham done move ahead.
Di Super League disaster  no be sometin wey pipo go forget for a long time
but I fit tell u say di Kroenke owners no dey go anywia.
So, e dey Arteta hand to improve tins, build strong team and get im tactics right next season, if not di proud Gunners fit crash and burn.
De Gea no go gree to be No 2
Even say Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea get im contract till 2023, im agent dey test microphone, to see di club wey go wan sign am.
I dey hear for inside Old Trafford say even say e get gud parole wit di current No 1 Dean Henderson, De Gea no go siddun take bench for long.
I dey hear say Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid get interest.
We no go deny say di 30-year-old dey on top of im career, even say som pipo for inside di club believe say e don drop small for di past two years.
Manager Solskjaer tok say, Goalkeeper departments dey veri tight knit group.
Dem dey work for preparation, dem get different gym session, personal session to di rest of di squad and dem dey stay togeda more.
Naturally dem dey create a bond and di spirit for di goalkeepin department dey high.
Na beta competition.
I am sure the coach is right however if De Gea doesnt regain recognition for the No1 stitched onto the back of his shirt and is left on the bench in crucial games, I am reliably informed he will move out of Old Trafford.
I take West Brom to bounce back yet again
After one season back in the Premier League we again say goodbye to West Bromwich Albion.
The key to yet another quick bounce back from the Championship will be whether or not fire-fighting manager Sam Allardyce can be persuaded to stay.
He is disappointed to have lost his reputation as never having been relegated with any club and the board at West Brom have a lot of work to do if they want to keep him.
Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Conor Gallagher and Okay Yokuslu will return to their parent clubs after being on loan but Matheus Pereira, Callum Robinson, Hal Robson-Kanu and Karlan Grant can impress in the lower league.
Who is the fastest player in the Manchester City squad?
No, it isnt Raheem Sterling.
Manager Pep Guardiola set up a practice whereby each player had to control the ball and sprint 10 yards.
There are some very fast movers in the City squad but Gabriel Jesus proved he was the fastest.
The best is yet to come from Havertz
Thomas Tuchel has been singing the praises of Kai Havertz and pointed to his two goals recently scored against Fulham.
Tuchel recognises that since Kai arrived at Stamford Bridge from Bayer Leverkusen, things have not gone well for the German.
Moving from a foreign country and having to handle lockdown restrictions made things difficult and of course he caught Covid-19 and had to battle back to fitness.
If they do not win their next game, Sheffield United will become the first team since the 1904-05 season to have gone without winning two consecutive games.
Kane is keen to move on from his boyhood club after Tottenham also missed out on the Champions League for a second straight year.
Chairman for di economic and financial crimes commission (EFCC) Abdulrasheed Bawa don make declaration say dem go resuscitate di Bank Employees Assets Declaration Act of 1986 to block loopholes wey bankers don create to sanitise di kontri's financial system
According to wetin Bawa tok, dem take di decision due to di role wey dem dey expect make bankers play for di fight against corruption, as di EFCC don mandate am to ensure say dem comply wit di Act.
Section 1 for di Bank Employees Declaration of Assets Act 1986 don make am mandatory for Evri employee for di bank to make full disclosure of assets upon employment for annual basis.
Di law wey dey under Section 7 Sub-Section 1 stipulates say na offence e go be for an employee of a bank make e own assets in excess of dia legitimate and probable income
Afta di EFCC chairman don stipulate di deadline, consequences go arise as a result of non-declaration by bank employees
Spelt out penealty of 10 years inprisonment upon conviction as well as forfeiture of assets wey dey beyond and above legitimate income and probable earnings for dat kain bank employees.
Dis piece of legislature don dey so tey 1986 under di military
So tey, dis part of di constitution don dey ineeffective by those wey suppose dey implement am ordinarily
Bankers don aware of dis legislation but di level wey dem dey comply no dey encouraging
For di 80s, dem dey hand form to bankers wey dem go complete and submit
But as e dey go for awa kontri, dem don abandon di implementation of dat provision for di law , and dem no longer consideram as a fundamental part for di banking profession.
Stakeholders dey blame di failure on top di authorities wey include di CBN, Chartered Institute of Bank of Naija (CIBN) and Bankers Committee for some kain abnormalities wey dey di industry.
According to wetin dem dey tok, dem say diz regulators dey rely on di bank wey dem suppose supervise, make e supply information
For instance, dem don argue am say di failed banks episode apun some months afta dem give di regulator for diz banks clean bill of health
Dis suggest say dem don doctor di information wey di bank supplied
Naija don dey battle case like corruption and money laundering and dem dey accuse bankers and banking officials say dem be part of it
Some moni don remain redundant for plenti accounts bikos some account owners don kpeme which some bank officials go convert to dia own as dem go leave families of di account owners for penury.
Dis dey in spite of di fact say di banking sector no strange to self-regulation,given its tempting, delicate and di operating system wey dey fragile
Di CIBN Act of 2007 don dey regulate di banking system
E get code of conduct wey bankers don agree pon wit CBN
Disciplinary tribunal wey get power for di high court dey and e dey ensure say dem bring reported infractions, unethical conduct and indiscipline before di tribunal, and sanctions wey dem recommended for formal prosecution.
But one of di challenges be di weak reporting system wey bankers get wey dey lead to di inability of CIBN make dem take appropriate actions.
Di spirit wey stan gidigba for di back of di Act of 1986 na to make clear, di financial standing wey bank employee get for di time of employment, and afta years of service, in a bid wey go make dem ascertain say dem dey commensurate dia legitimate earnings wit dia lifestyles wey dey current
Na dis dey kom on top di heels of allegation say some bankers be direct beneficiaries for fraudulent transactions wey dem dey carry out for di bank
Wetin be common knowledge be say di declaration of assests by public officers wey include di civil servants, pesin wey dey politically exposed and those wey dey for di Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).
Dem require dem make dem declare dia assets evri four years
On top di election and appointment of political office holders, before dem assume office dem suppose declare di assets wey dey get pon entry kom declare am again for di exit point
Dem do dis declaration by oath
For anoda word, execution and attestation before di high court or some oda superior officer for di law dey
Di Naija customs service (NCS), Naija Immigration Service (NIS), among odas, dem don covered by di Code of Conduct Act wit regard to di declaration of dia assets.
As e dey so finacial experts believe say di impression wey di directive to bankers create make dem comply wit di of legislation wey dey pre-exist dey amount to stigmatisation and e dey also isolates bank employees, wey dey puts dem in di limelight.
In oda words, d belief of revisiting of di Act of 1986 dey encourage di policy of isolation wey dey kos apprehension in di industry.
Dis na di concern say di Act fit kos enrolment into di banking profession to further go down as a result of stigmatisation.
Some stakeholders don caution against di drama about stigmatisation, arguing say plenti bankers, from di highest cadre to di level wey low pass, dey live above dia means.
According to wetin dem tok , an average banker even from dia early point of calling, dey cut corners by conniving wit customers say dem go beat di system.
Dem insist say for evri major corruption, banker wey dey facilitate di transaction dey
E dey laudible say di EFCC dey try use di Act for reason wey good
Di worry be say di banks wey di goment no own per se although di goverment get shares in dem
Dem dey use bank save moni
Di koko be say laws wey dey check illicit enrichment dey
Article 20 for di UN Convention Against Corruption dey explicit on top dis
Section 7 for di EFCC act don empower EFCC make e dey investigate pesin wey hin lifestyle no commensurate wit di means of income wey dem get
Dem believe am for some part say di politically exposed person dey plunder di assests for dis kontri plenti of dem dey untouchable
Dem accuse EFCC say e no fair and even-handed
If dem sanitise di banking sector, we go get ripple effect for oda sectors of di economy
Dem take all diz measure to strengden di fight against corruption, and not to stigmatise di banking profession or portray it as di scapegoat wey dey witin di system.
Besides, di banking career no be one kain rouguish profession
Some bankers be di forefront of exposing some of di mega corruption issues wey wedon see di EFCC making headway.
Part of why dis law dey be say e dey ensure make di kontri dey free from financial crimes, and make e dey also block loopholes wey unscrupulous players dey esploit
While dem dey hope say make di Act of 1986 na sincere attempt at sanitising di system , dem suppose create platform wey go report thresholds of deposits on a daily basis, and di regulator suppose dey able to access it to know di declarations wey dem make.
E dey make am easy reference to wetin dem don declare as legitimate income to check those wey dey live above dia means
Moses Amadi wey be researcher na hin send dis piece from Lagos

Farmers don raise concern as CBN don suspend anchor Borrowers loans
Farmers and oda stakeholders for di agricultural sector dey express dia concern over di suspension of agricultural loans wey dem dey access through di Naija Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) by di Central Bank of Naija (CBN) recently
I dey think say una dey run/jappa for me
E dey handle most of di agric loans to di farmers by di CBN especially its popular Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP).
Di apex bank say di fraudulent activities for NIRSAL loans under di ABP and dem order for di suspension of such loans until dem don pay all previous beneficiaries back.
E no dey clear yet if di suspension dey only on di Anchor Borrowers Programme alone or e also include those of Micro finance banks through NIRSAL.
Di suspension don ground loan activities fror NIRSAL and farmers dey worried say among odas, di timing dey wrong, as many of dem don go far wit plans say dem go expand dia agricultural production
One farmer wey dey really worried say wetin dey apun now dey threaten di economy and e dey call on top di CBN make dem please step in and save millions of Naija pipo make dem access diS loans for agricultural production.
Plenti farmers wey dey wait for NIRSAL disbursement for di social media handle don express sadness over di suspension of di loan facility as e dey threaten to ground dia dreams for expansion.
As hin dey react to di development for di chat wit awa Agric Editor, di leadership of all di farmers association of Naija, wey Architect Kabiru Ibrahin dey head am, tok say thoughdi CBN dey blames NIRSAL for di non-performance of di ABP, make dem do di needful in fishing out those wey dey responsible.
Make e dey kontinu to provide qualified farmers di support wey dem need
We dey urge di CBN make dem do due dilligence in prequalifying farmers wey dey participate for di programme bikos several cases of briefcase farmers wey dey pose as real farmers abound.
Dem collude wit some NIRSAL officials make dem defraud di programme
Timely repayment no dey forthkoming for di ABP bikos of di fraud
Anyone wey give bribe to take a loan wit an interest component no get desire to repay am
awa initial understanding of di role of di NIRSAL na to primarily incentivize commercial banks make dem embrace lending for agricultural production but certainly no be to prequalify prospective loan seeking companies.
dis na how corruption take take over and di farmers now be di worst for it
Hin say we dey call on top di CBN make e reverse di decision on top di disbursement of di ABP support to farmers
Dr Femi Oke wey be di AFAN chairman for South-west zone say di suspension of di NIRSAL loans go impact food production for di kontri greatly
As Oke dey follow di News Agency of Naija (NAN) for Lagos don urge di CBN make dem investigate di allegations wey dey against NIRSAL witout undermining di various efforts wey farmers get toward achieving food security and self-sufficiency.
Hin call on top di CBN make dem resolve di issues wey dey surround di suspension of di NIRSAL loans
Di AFAN official say dem disappointed plenti farmers by di suspension of di Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) and NIRSAL loans, as dem dey provide a lot of support to smallholder farmers.
NAN also reported say di CBN recently suspend all loans wey di NIRSAL disburse following di allegation of corruption by its officials
Wetin dey una mind
Di memo say dem go only reverse di decision afta dem pay all outstanding loan wey farmers neva pay back
According to wetin Oke yarn wen we hear about di suspension of di NIRSAL loans, we don know immediately say dis no good for di farmers and di sector.
for wetin we hear, dem base di suspension for di ABP
We want make CBN lay more emphasis on how dem go go about am bikos some of di farmers don go do interview on NIRSAL loans, while odas dey await di disbursement of di funds.
wetin go be dia fate now?
hin say, e no good and we dey implore make goverment chook mouth for di mata and address am
Oke don urge di goverment make di federal goverment intervene, in order make e no jeopardise di efforts wey farmers wey don invest for hin farm, and those wey dey wait for di loans wey go make dem plant dis season
Dem need do something immediately make e no go jeopardise di effort of di farmers say dem ready to go back to di farm
Plenti farmers specifically in di South-West dey wait on top di loan and dem dey expect say by now dem suppose disburse am
Very few of awa members don get access to di loan, plenti neva get access to di interview
me self neva do di interview
I still dey wait make dem select me
hin stressed am say, farmers no dey hapi on top di suspension of loan
Di AFAN chairman don tok am for di NIRSAL selection process say e dey slow bikos of di COVID-19 pandemic such dat na only about 10 per cent of awa farmers don benefit for di loan.
Hin say we want make di federal goverment clarify if di suspension go dey on di CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme alone and on di Microfinance bank through NIRSAL
Immediate reaction from di NIRSAL no dey ova di suspension of di loans as an official, wey crave make e dey anonymous, tok say na only di CBN fit tok on top di mata and e don tok.
Sources for di apex bank tok say di suspension dey to ensure efficiency for di system and assure farmers for di bank's commitment to guarantee food security

I don taya for all dis hustling
Hunger, poverty and di challenge for innovative food storage
Gimme evrithin wey una get
If una visit plenti offices across di kontri for lunchtime during di months of may, june, july and August, chances dey high say una go find a good number of workers wey dey munch am for mouth.
True as corn don dey season one of di delicacies for dis time na di combination of roasted corn ( wey dem popularly code-name as mouth organ) and di pear for Africa pear.
Coconut na ocassional substitute wey dey close to pear dis writer get good authority ova am say plenti pipo dey find di coconut and a mouth-organ combination say e delicious
Outside dis months wey corn and pear dey season di combination no dey dey available
During di harvest months enough corn and pear wey go sustain di kontri for a substantial period, perhaps na an entire year, dem go don harvest am
But wit inadequate knowledge and how dem go utilize modern and cost-effective storage and preservation methods, tonnes of maize and pear just dey waste Evri year.
Di same dey apply to oda agricultural commodities for Naija
For harvest periods, surplus dey often dey, but in di absence of proper storage, a huge proportion of dis harvest dey waste.
Dis perennial issues don pose one huge threat to di economic well-being of farmers, di major wey dey operate for di subsistence level.
Di challenge wey be di kwanta of poor storge and preservation of food dey pose to awa kontri, don bekom more haunting wen pesin dey consider di difficulties wey confront us for di post-COVID era
E dey imperative say beyond di volume of awa agricultural output wey dey improve make we look critically at how we go empower farmers across di kontri manage dia harvests beta
Na dis go translate to immense economic value not only to di farmers demselves wey go enhance dia livelihoods, but also to di kontri as a whole, as plenti food go dey available for extended periods , for consumption and export
Plenti research organisations and universities don introduce different solutions to di kwanta of post-harvest losses as di years dey pass
Di innovations wey dem don develop, being home-grown dey unique bikos dem dey reflect di reality of awa local goverment
No be say dem dey relatively cheap, as dem dey often dey technically uncomplicated, but farmers fit adopt dem readily
For di area of fish farming, one innovation dey wey dem dey call am iced-fish box wey dem go use harvest fish go store am so e go remain fresh on transportation to di market from di farm or ahead of processing and storage.
Dem don develop special smoking kilns wey go replace di labour-intensive, traditional fish smoking methods wey no dey efficient and e dey unhealthy
Outputs wey dey commot for dis kilns be good enough for export and e dey several multiples of wetin dem dey ordinarily obtain for traditional fish-smoking methods.
Naija researchers don also produce composite packaging material wey dem fit use package dat kain smoked fish or even smoked meat as di case fit be, preserving di end-product and e dey boost di commercial appeal
If to say na beans, corn or rice wey don discoloured, mouldy, smelly or e dey infected wit weevils, grains dey pose gbege of storage for farmers and e dey lead to considerable financial losses
For di past, grains wey dem dey export from Naija don face rejection bikos of di unacceptable level of residual pesticides wey dem contain
Local researchers wey dey active for di area of grain preservation, churning out of a handful of innovative solutions ova di years
For instance, solar dryers wey dem develop for different products dey
If to say di abundance of sunshine wey dey awa kontri and di simplicity of construction of dis dryers, dem dey available for average farmers
Dem fit replicate construction easily for di local setin
Dis solar dryers work dey enhance di efficiency of drying of agricultural produce
Dem dey do dis as dem dey concentrate di rays of di sun on a particular surface, wey go dey enhance drying efficiency over di traditional method wey dem dey take use spread grains, cassava, plantain peeling and odas indiscriminately under di sun
local researchers don develop specially constructed steel drums wey wen dem shut am bikom airtight (hermit) and e dey allow make farmers store grains ova several months
Dem be specialised storage silos wey fit help store and preserve grains over plenti months
In fact one twin silo dey, wey fit accommodate 100 tonnes of grains at a time
Local researchers don also develop bio-pesticide as an alternative to chemical pesticides
Chemical pesticides wey dey available though effective against pest dey harmful to man and hin environment, too
Bio-pesticide for di oda hand, dey much safer and dem dey constitute no hazard for environment
Dem make One of such pesticide (NSPRIDUST) wey be an innovation by di Naija stored product research institute, from diatomaceous earth, wey be a powdery form wey dey occure for rock naturally for Naija
Bio-pesticides go help make Naija grains potentially dey more acceptable for di export market
We no fit leave fruit and vegetable out of di problem of poor preservation and storage for Naija
As we dey import apple, pears, strawberries and oda fruits round-di-clock plenti no dey wey we go yarn on top Naija's fruit exports
Again, over time Naija researchers don herald different solutions to dis yawa wey dey ground
One shed wey dem construct specially for fruit and vegetable for instance, wey dem make of simple and raw materials wey be local ones , and e dey help farmers preserve fruits and vegegtables for long
Den, di fruit dryer, wey dey dry certain fruits dey help to preserve dem
Local researcher dey work fervently on top fruits and vegetable conservation using di principle of evaporative cooling
Evaporative cooling na di cooling wey dey result make water evaporate from a surface
Incidentally, di use of evaporative cooling for fruit and vegetable preservation no be new thing, as dem don dey practice am for traditional setin for Naija
Researchers don dey find way wey dem go take use enhance di efficiency of traditional evaporative cooling systems wey dem go use preserve di shelf life of fruits and vegetables ova a duration of time
For tubers of yam and potatoes, local researchers don kom up wit products like ventilated yam barns wey go dey store yam tubers, diffused-light store wey go dey for di storage of potatoes, cassava root warehouse wey go dey store cassava roots among odas
Doubt no dey say widespread adoption of dis technologies by farmers across di kontri go help to considerably stem di tide of post-harvest losses for Naija
Na dis, one suppose repeat go transalate to significant economic value wey no go be for only farmers and di agricultural chain rate wey wide but also for di entire kontri as well
To get di agricultural value chain make e increasingly adopt diz innovations go entail patient and sysyematic engagement
Farmers cooperatives and association go be good medium wey go help reach farmers across di kontri wit information and education
na so di media and media institutions
Research institutes and faculties for agriculture for awa various universities, wey be vital hotbeds for innovation, go work collaboratively so tey dem go jointly share and popularise innovations wey dem dey emanate diafrom
Agricultural chambers for commerce be potential source of popularising dis innovations especially as e dey among policymakers and influencers suppose be involved also
Di increasing penetration of smartphones across di kontri also present opportunity wey go reach millions of farmers wit information and education

As di Federal Goment open four land borders last week don slow down keepkeep wey dem dey do for katsina, Daily Trust fit tok.
Before dom shout am, pipo wey dey sell grains go disquise say dem be agent from company kom buy bigbig farm produce keep to store and get profit later. 
As one dealer take tok, despite say dem match leg ontop to dey carry rice and other food enter Nigeria , market pipo still get double mind to keep market ontop say goment  fit change dia mind anytime depend on wetin dey ground.
Alhaji Aminu Hussain, wey dey sorghum, say to dey keepkeep market no be new tin for di  market, but e kom go up wit di new  agricultural policy of dis administration and border wey dem close.
Many of us chop beta gain ontop farm produce for last year, na why pipo kom out quick dis harvest time to dey buy keep but border wey dem open don slow am down.
The fear wey we get na say price for food go still kom down. 
E add join say farm produces wey no kom out plenti bikos of bad way of dem bandit dis year, don give market pipo mind to keepkeep dia market.
Rice, maize and sorghum n aim dem put eye.
Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana, wey dey sell grain for  Bakori market, say as dem shout to open border again  last week don get hand ontop price for major food for di market.
E no be like last year we, by dis time, maize dey around N8,000 and N9,500, sorghum dey N7,000, nah N14,000 and N13,000 dem dey sell dem now.
Dis shout of open border again wey dem shout down spoil di price of paddy rice from N14,000 go N12,000, sorghum from N14,500 go N13,000 and maize from N15,500 go N14,000.
Tarzana add join say many market pipo comot hand to dey buy market bigbig afta dem shout am, get am for mind say di breeze from importation of food go enta anytime.
Our news pipo see say di land border wey dem open again get many eyes. 
Plenti of di farmer and market pipo want make di border dey lock so dat dem go dey chop beta for di market wey we dey do for awa  house.
Pipo wey dey chop am and some other pipo hapi wit di development and dey expect say goment go allow make dem dey import rice and other food. 
But goment kon fall dia hand as im tok say rice, chicken and turkey, oil for cook and other food still dey under ban to dey import. 
Sani Muazu Hunkuyi, wey be one agric expert, beg di goment make dem sumit give di pressure, allow food to dey enter. 
Goment don invest plenti agric sector and make we nor allow dat big investment enta water wit breeze of importation inside dis kontri
Na true say fear for food crisis don burst evriwia, but we fit reduce am wit farming wit water.
To dey import food go make dis economic recession wey dey di kontri worst to tackle, na im Muazu tok
E add join say yawa go gas for farmers dem if goment cancel dia policy ontop to make food plenti.
Why rice wey flood nor dey important to farmers dem. 
Di threat ontop food for Nigeria bikos of flood go soon be tin of di past as dem release FARO 66, one type of rice wey flood no fit kari.
 FARO 66, wey National Cereal Research Institute (NCRI) release give farming pipo dem be type wey get some tins wey dey different from wetin farmers for here sabi before.
Dis type tall pass other one wey farmers sabi.
Witi how im tall and some betabeta farming mata, e get power to survive palava of flood wella.
To kolet new tins among farmers dem dey always be big problem and as dem introduce FARO66 no dey different. 
But if dem farmer kolet am finish, di threat ontop food about rice mata go reduce.
For dis year field trip wey NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, capital of Kebbi State organise, farmers and dem oga dey introduced to dis new type afta a field trip wey dem do for di institute demonstration farm for di city.
For di demonstration farm, farmers dey expose to FARO66, wey stand gidigba wit flood inside farm and other rice follow di same flood waka.
Di two farm wey dey near each oda show di power to tanda wit flood wey FARO66 type get, wit all di wahala, e grow and strong.
One di farm of other type of rice, na di remaining of rice wey die remain dem see.
As im follow awa  news pipo talk, di oga for di NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi, Andrew Shema, say di FARO 66 go tanda wit flood if dem quick plant am.
E add join say, im stem wey hard and as e tall, if dem part am quick, di type go don grow reach size wey be say if flood com, di plant nor go gree for am.
He tok say FARO66 dey release two years ago but to kolet, as for di case wit any new tin, must be small small, tok say, if farmers dem don accept am wella, flood nor go be threat to rice farming again. 
As im take tok, to open di eyes of farmers dem as research ontop dis new type dey go front, dem carry dem join bodi to see how e dey go and to record result. 
E add join say science pipo wey dey ontop di research get sense say if dem allow farmers dem to see how dis plant fit take tanda wit flood, no be only to accept am go dey fast, to dey use sef go dey. 
Shema wey tok say as dem nor give dem plenti moni be dia major wahala for di research work, e call stakeholders dem to kom invest ontop dia idea for beta tomorrow as di research no go only develop di new type but e go still create job, and still develop economy for di kontri.
 E explain say dem still do public lecture wey dey among program wey dem do for di first day of di field day wey dem do, e say why dem introduce public lecture join dis year program na to show stakeholders dem say nah if moni wey reach dey n aim research fit get head.
E beg pipo wey get mouth for Nigeria and organization to kom drop put for research.
Di two days nah ontop to show how technology take enter farming
Wen we tok say he dey tanda wit flood, we no tok say flood no go affect am patapata.
Wetin we dey tok be say wit all di tin wey e get for bodi, e go tanda wit flood wahala reach one side. 
FARO 66 go tanda wit flood wahala bikos e tall pass FARO 44 and FARO 52.
Im stem still hard pass other one. 
To manage sky as in to plant quickquick na im be di key to tanda wit flood. 
To plant quickquick dey save bigbig if flood come.
 If rain don starts, farmers dem no need to dey waste time.
Dis one go make crop dey strong and hold leg for ground wella before flood go com, as im tok. 
Dem suppose start to dey plant sharpsharp.

Di eye wey dem put na bad tori of di goment  wey no gree tackle security mata for di country.
E get one sence wey wetin dey hapun make to take sabi governance wella, especially wit plenti plenti illegal weapon dem evriwia for Nigeria .
Di nation no dey good at all, but dey concern for di safety of im pipo.
Pipo dey cry for help for beta security of life and dere properties
As im be today, di way wey weapon dem wey dey illegal dey  plenti evri wia na serious wahala  for economic sustenance, unity and to dey togeda.
Na inside all dis kasala wey we take sabi wetin di link wey dey between governance and di illegal weapon wey dey evriwia be,  wey be main mata for dis time of awa  national life.
As Nigeria dey go up and down for di last two decades don make plenti Nigerians sabi wetin be di poverty governance.
As e take be like dat, e go beta for us make we sabi wetin governance be for simple sense and wetin in be for inside dis context.
Di Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary, Sixth Edition tok say governance na di way wey dem dey control one kontri or di way wey one kontri or institution deu dey control.
So, governance na di process of control and controlling activity wey dey a kontri join weapon wit im circulation.
Again, governance still fit dey look as di process wey dem goment  pipo dey hold power, authority and di way wey dem dey give policy wey pertain to pesin life and economic decision for di beta beta of di pipo.
As e be, to dey run di goment  go take make dem use decision wey dey good and wey go get good impact on top di management and di sharing of resources wey include moni, pesin and material.
 E go involve di regulation, implementation and enforcement for d policy wey pesin want, wey go be for objective wey get target, goals and aspiration through capacity.
 As e be, governance  na to dey control di development wey pesin want, wey be say,  to protect life and property of kontri pipo tru d regulate of arms and weapon dem be koko.
As e be so, e get plenty reason wey explain di poverty wey never stop since for governance for Nigeria .
For example, poor institutional capacity na im cause goment  failure, wey no make  everything  balance in di wey dem dey do justice and fairness, wey cause oppression and jagajaga for mind.
To add join dis one, na as dem dey do ojoro dey help dere family dem, as dem dey selfish, ethnic partial wey don cut to dey togeda ontop decision making troway, and as di political representative no dey too do dia work.
Di mata wey di Chairman for di National peace Committee (NPC) and d former Military Head of State, General Abdulsallami Abubakar tok for Transcorp Hilton for Abuja say e pass 6 million illegal weapon wey dem fit trace to di kontri pipo, many of dem no get work and dem dey hungry and angry.
Di nomba of di small small weapon wey dey Nigeria for di hand of kontri pipo wey no dey military reach 6,145,000 and armed forces and law enforcement pipo count dia own to be 586,000 weapon.
E still tok go front about di sekuriti problem wey dey di kontri.
E tell all di nation say na 80,000 Nigeria pipo don die for recent month and like three million pipo  be Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) evriwia for di kontri bikos say sekuriti problem dey plenti and illegal weapon dem waka evriwia for di country.
E kon tok say di sekuriti forces no just dey over work but dem no get moni, and e tok say dem fit do beta if dem give dem beta weapon, equipment and make dem give dem moni wey go dey accountable. 
As di forma head of state and di chairman for National Peace Committee (NPC) take shuk mouth for di mata, e don show say we suppose take governance serious ontop plenty die-die tins for di kontri.
Wela, e don show say pipo  wey even dey power and authority dey live for inside fear.
For dis side dem suppose hear cry for help of d pipo make dem try reduce as illegal weapon dem waka evriwia.
For onetime dem tok say na for Africa weapon dey increase pass.
Small arms, Mass Atrocities & Migration for Nigeria, tok say na as weapon too dey increase na im make bring gunpipo, n aim still kos di scatascata of many Nigeria pipo.
Di report tok say na as weapon dey plenti for  Southern Nigeria n aim make kasala plenti for area like village wahala, cult, kidnapping, tribe and religion gbege,  and militancy for di Niger Delta.
And na d same way di report tok say for Northern Nigeria side, as per say corruption don plenti for dat side, dem get plenti land wey no get pesin wey dey rule am, and dem no too get work and na dis tins don make criminal and wahala mani for dia side.
Di report tok say wetin we tok before hapun bikos say Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) dey increase. 
Di mata dey question di feasibility of di National Task Force on top Small Arms and Light Weapons.
So, we must to find di way to dey go front, even say e no dey clear and we no fit settle am.
We suppose face di mata and tackle as di illegal weapon dey dey evriwia for di kontri wit all di goment  structure wey dey tackle di mata for di federal, state and local goment  level. 
And as e be, di National Task Force for Small Arms and Light weapons  and di office of di National Sekuriti Adviser for di President (ONSA) must tight moremore to tackle di illegal arm wey don plenty wit to disturb and to stop am.
As e kon be like dis, we need program wey go teach how dem dey carry pipo for mind for governance and di sekuriti policy dey needed no be only community policing but policing for individual and group to dey share intelligence.
Di main tin na transparency, accountability and responsibility for beta governance, if dem dey, we no go fit comot all di illegal weapon wet dey evriwia.

E go be dis result wey give Atletico beta head to head record pass Barca, wey dey number 10 on top table without Gerard Pique wey don get injury for three months.
Di internet don bring fundamental shift enter economy dem wey no near each oda bikos of brier enter ross-border trade and investment, wey distance far, time zone and language and wey national goment regulation different.
E-commerce dey foster direct access to market wey no near and e dey promote globalisation and commercial activities plus e dey komot distinction between domestic and foreign companies to di extent wey e no go possible to know wia di product from kom.
E-commerce no dey limited to buying of product alone, e include e-mail, plus oda communication platform dem, all di informate or service wey company fit offer customer on top net, from pre-purchase information to aftasale service and support.
Di major significance wey e commerce get dey for di fact say e dey encourage system of tradin wey be single world, wey access through electronic means to take get good and services dem dey facilitate from different parts of di world.
Most of di statue wey dey for ground for inside nigeria dey lag behind toward di development and growth of e-commerce in particular and di whole ICT. 
For Nigeria, plenty legal research and study don dey conducted.
Plenty for inside di study dem carry opinion say di legal system for Nigeria ey lag behind for legislation wey involve ICT and say di statutory law dem wey don dey ground no dey adequate to take address some of di legal issue wey dey affect e-commerce.
Dis issue dem include electronic evidence cybercrimes, security and data production, e-payment system and inevitably trans-border issues, plus plenty oda ones.
Therefore, need dey to bring out legal and regulatory measure wey dey proper, to take govern di regime wey just dey kom.
Dem don tok plenty times say for inside Nigeria, significant effort to take regulate e-commerce-related activity demstill dey di stage of Sraft Bill before di National Assembly.
E dey important to know say, even wia dem pass dis bill into law, Nigeria fit still face new legal issue for dis area wey go call for legislative intervention.
Wit di speed wey di internet dey take work on top commercial transaction for Nigeria, especially for inside banking and communication sector of di economy, di best wey dem fit suggest be say di legal issues and problems dem wey dey confront e-commerce presently for di kontri should be addressed directly and espeditiously, for di interest of di teeming population of Nigeria customer dem.
To achieve dis, make dem pressure di National Assembly to take pass bill concerning electronic commerce as top priority so dat dem go enact dem into law as quick as possible.
For small time, make awa court take giant step to interprete di traditional law dem wey dey ground in a liberal way make dem take cut gap in order to make di laws dem get ammend to electronic transaction, particularly for di emerging trend of dis information age wey we dey.
Indeed, dem argue say legislation no be di only means wey electronic transaction and attendant documentation fit dey legal.
Di court fit also adapt to recognise electronic transaction for di absence of legislation or private contract.
As former Justice Bungham don tok am before: di common law dey di hand of judges di same kind facility [as law merchant dem] make e fit adapt to di need of di general public, principle no dey alter, but old rules to dey apply di change, and new rules go begin exist.
We dey hope say goment go adopt dis activism wey Nigerian judges de do for inside judiciary, Supreme Court judges sef dey involve, expexially for area wia awa existin legislation dey grossly inadequate, comprehensive or elaborate enough to take address legal challenges for inside new technological advancements.  
Dis one go set better precedence to make sure say e-commerce consumer dem get protection, to bring investor dem and bring economic development plus stability inside di kontri.
Di koko issue for contract inside e-commerce na documentation and signature.
Di provision for inside section 4 of di statute of Fraud, 1677 or  Lagos State Law Reform (Contract) Law and awa various statute on real property and landed instrument dem, all of which require make dem write certain contract dem and execute dem duly.
Di question now be say shey electronic sign-off dey constitute valid sign-off contract by email or by binding?
Dem still neva settle many of dis issues dem even for inside UK although some decision dey favour toward to interprete electronic signature
So marks for inside email wey ey satisfy di tradional requirement of writing and due execusion.
E-commerce transaction na transaction wey no involve paper wey dem dey do through magnetic material like tapes or disk.
Dis one dem be contradiction to di transaction wey be say na paper dem dey take do am wey dey embodied for permanent form and typically expressed in words and figures wey dem dey use signature authenticate.
Dem no fit alter dat kind transaction without say dem alter di face of di document.
As e concern signature, di provision for inide section 93 (2)(3), evidence act 2011, electronic signature wey relate to data message go conveniently satisfy any requirement for signature wey dem take hand sign as long as say e dey sufficient to take identify an electronic record to di person.
Di  provision for inside article 7 of di United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model law for e-commerce 1996 dey equally trite on top dis issue.
Thus, for di purpose of establishing proof of electronic signatures. 
To dey use password, identification, user names etc fit suffice.
Hence one fit safely tok say electronic signature for purpose of execution dey admissible for evidence provided say dem certify and incorporate am for electronic communication during any e-transaction.
Also, oda legal challenge dem wey dey affect e-commerce include di formation of contracts. 
Di element for better formation of contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to enter inside legal relation.
Di question be say, for which point dem fit make offer wit regard to electronic business transaction or now to differentiate between invitation to treat and offer electronic transaction, at which point we fit tok say dem make intention to enter legal relation?
E-commerce require confidence and trust di satisfaction wey dey transmit order or invoice neva get any matter and e dey kom from whoever e appear to kom from.
Need dey for guarantee concerning level of privacy/confidenciality for information matter.
Lastly, di alarming rate of cybercrime for inside Nigeria, plus high level of illiterate.
No doubt say electronic transaction na aspect of commercial transaction for Nigeria and e don kom to stay dis time.
Make di goment go pass to dey make law, make dem activate as dem go take dey use di electronic platform for dem commercial interaction and for delivery of goment service.

Chad don pass new chartes as dem call Deby son president
Chad don pass charter wey declare Mahamat Idris Deby as President, even as rumour dey social media say he don die.
Mahamat don take over to take replace im papa, Idriss deby wey dem kill dis week.

Calling for calm, di army also announce curfew for 6pm and dem close di border for di kontri, as dem suspend di constitution and dissolve National Assembly.
However, politician wey be opposition for inside chad don reject di army appointment of President Idris deby's son to take over fter im papa die.
Expert dem tok say under di law for inside Chad, di speaker of parliament suppose don kolekt power aftr Deby die, no be im son.
Wetin di constitution tok be say if di president n dey abi e die, then di speaker of di parliament go take charge of di kontri for 40 days and so dem go put transition in place until dem do election, Hiba Morgan wey dey Al Jazeera dey report from capital, Ndjamena tok for ealy Tuesday.
[But] di military announce ay dem don dissolve di legislative assembly and dem don dissolve di constitution, so wetin dem do be say dem replace di constitution wit dem own set of rules.
Dem fit komot Chelsea points afta di brawl wit Leicester
Chelsea dey face deduction of point from FA for di team as dem fail to kontrol dem players, as Mirror report.
Inside seven years, dem don catch di team dey show hot temper to opponents seven times.
Di recent brawl for inside one match on Tuesday night Leicester mark di seven encounter wey Chelsea get wit Premier League teams.
Na katakata mark di match wey apun last week between Chelsea and Leicester among players of both teams.
Wit di same kind of offence for di past, di FA decide say dem go punish Chelsea.
Leicester sef dey face charges for dem role inside di brawl wey involve players and coaches as Ricardo Pereira take challenge Ben Chilwell.
For 2016, dem also charge Chelsea for indiscipline wey make dem warn dem, afta dem appeal against 375,000 dollar fine for di part wey dem play for one burst-up during match against Tottenham.
If e affect dem, di point wey dem go komot go affect dem season very well as dem dey enter final campaign to take get spot for top four.
US Africom for Nigeria? Heck No! 
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
Dat na di resentful and contemptuous opinion many British pipo get for di thousands of American GIs wey station for inside several military bases for Britain durin di Secon World War.
Di gum-chewing, brash, hard-drinking and womanising  soldier dem wey from America comedey frequently get into pub fight and knife fight weu dey dangerous wey dey kos bad feeling for di yanks among di locals.
And dis don be di pattern wey America soldiers dem dey take behave evriwia for di hundred of America military base oversea from Okinawa for inside Japan, Stuttgart inside Germany, Incirlik and Diyarbakir for Turkey and Pampanga inside  Philippines.
Na why i dey upset, like plenty Nigeria pipo, say na for virtual meetin last week wit di di Secretary of State of di United States of America, Antony Blinken, na dem report say president Buhari ask United States to consider as dem go take relocate di African Command (Africom) of im military wey dey for Stuttgart for inside southern German city of presently kom Africa.
We dey thingk am say wit dis kin call, president Buhari dey make way for Nigeria to host Africom.
For di first place, na breach of protocol for  President Buhari to do dat meeting wit di American Secretary of State.
Dem suppose do di meetin wit Blinken's Nigerian opposite number, Geoffrey Onyeama, who o kom carri di detail go meet president later.
Yes, America na superpower and all, but protocol na protocol and dem soppose follow am strictly  for evri circumstance.
We understand say Nigeria dey face big internal security wahala wey be like say e pass di best effort wey goment and security establishment for inside di nation dey make to take tackle am.
Terrorist insurgency wey no dey tire for di North East banditry, kidnapping inside di North West, farmers/herders clash dem all over di kontri and as dem dey target and kill security and law enforcement personnel dem and oda Nigeria pipo plus di destruction of institutional building for di South East, na dem join take be di cokctail of insecurity wey don dey ravage di kontri.
But even at that, di call to take host Africom on top Nigeria siol when we consider m against various issues and implications of dis move to Nigeria difficult to justify.
Africom na one amng nine of dat kind command wey di America military establish say make e dey serve America strategic interest around di world.
By dem rule and way of operation, dis commands, particularly di ones wey dey outside America like Africom, dem no set dem up primarily to concern demselves wit security and law enforcement issuefor dem area of coverage.
Dem only do so when such issue dey affect di interest of America directly for di area and for such situation, dem no dey mandated to yield dem modus operandi and share intelligence wit di local security and law enforcement agancy dem 
If dem set Africom up for Nigeria for instance, e go be island on im ownas e go restrict access to Nigerians of all category and establishing a jurisdiction withing di teritorial area of di base wey go dey virtually off limit to Nigerian security and law enforcement agancy dem.
As e dey always apun wit America military base wey dey outside America, Africom go be forward operating base for disruptive intelligence operations and e go source for act of sabotage and destabilisation against host kontri.
For dis particular case of Africom, part of im original concept na to kontrol as di strategic influence of Nigeria dey grow for West Africa and Africa as we get successful peace enforecement efforts for Liberia and Sierra Leone and awa beta record of peace keepin around di world.
Di one wey dey before Africom na di Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) wey di Clinton administration set up to take counter di strategic interest of Nigeria for inside Africa.
Di Secretary of State for president Clinton, di dour-faced California attorney, Warren Christopher, be visit a nomba of African countries secretly to sell di idea. 
But bikos Nigeria na di target, he pointedly komot am from im itinerary.
Senegal, wey no far from Liberia and Sierra Leone, na im suppose be di coordinating base of di ACRI and though dem see am initiative to facilitate assistance of America to African humanitarian issues, im secret protocol dem mistake for military and dem target Nigeria strategically.
Due mainly to undisguised hostility to di idea from France, which was averse to seeing di Americans trying to butt into an area it considers its exclusive sphere of influence, dem review di concept of di ACRI.
For di review, wey draw di expertise of america Military, intelligence, political and academic personalities and institutions wey di America congress carry kom for dem secret sessions, di Americans dem consider and realise di need to set up one AFrican command to add to di oda command wey don dey already and dey cover oda continent for inside di world.
Thus, to follow on di reccomendation of experts wey gather, wey dem kom form all angle of political and security establishments for inside America, na di Bush Junior administration set Africom up wit mandate wey wide pass to contain Nigeria but also to keep eye on top di strategic penetration wey Chinese pipo dey do for inside Africa.
Na as US Central Command (USCENTCOM) take be to Middle East and Asia, na so Africom go be to Africa, as e base for Florida, European Command (EUCOM), as e base for Stuttgart, Germany, is to Europe and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), also based in Florida, is to Latin America and di Caribbean.
Di presence of French military don surround Nigeria already as dem dey for Niger, Cameroun, Chad and Benin.
Di America pipo also get drone base for inside Niger.
To add Africom to di mix for inside Nigeria go amount to a complete capitulation of awa strategic interest to both France and America.
As we get am for mind say awa strategic interest plus profile for Africa no dey always follow wit di one for France and America, to host Africom for Nigeria go be di same thing like make we allow wolf enter chicken cage.
Notin dey inside di insecurity cahllenge wey dey face di kontri wey awa armed forces no fit cope wit. 
Dis one na afta di military force wey eventually secure Liberia and Seirra Leone against army of insurgents wey dey well-entrenched and organised for inside di kontri dem from a long logistical supply line thousands of mile;  di army of Joshua Dogonyaro, Victor Malu and Maxwell Khobe, to mention few of di plenty gallant Nigeria soldier wey distinguish demsef for di operation dem.
E dey regretable say di Nigeria military, don fall from high standard wey dem take know dem, dem dey struggle now to cope wit di activity of non-state actors internally.
But intrinsically and essentially, di military for Nigeria still carry di capacity and capability to defeat dis threat to awa nationl security if dem get di correct leadership, doctrine plus motivation. 
We need all di assistance and coopration wey di America pipo fit give us if dem wan give us.
But as dem don hold us for hand to take host Africom with awa circumstance in view of im antecedent and implication to awa strategic interest, for awa soil.
Upon say dem dey face challenge, Plateau target 7m metric tons of Irish potato
For Nigeria, na Plateau state be nomba one wey dey plant Irish potato as dem dey produce am for nine of di 17 local goment area wey dey di state.
Di Potato Value Chain Support Project of di African Development Bank (AfDB)initiative don Plateau as state wey get 90 per cent of di potato production for inside di kontri as kontri like Chad, Ghana, Niger, Benin and oda ones dey get large supply of potato from Nigeria. 
Di large potato production for inside Plateau State, according to PotatoPRO.com, wey be leading source for informate for global potato industry, don make Nigeria di nomba four big kontri for inside sub-sahara Africa.
However, farmer dem tok say dam wey no good reach and bad road network, plus as di cost of fertilizer and oda farmin input kontinu to dey stand as major setback for di production of potatoes for inside di nation and to export.
Oda challenge wey dey contribute to low yield and loss for harvest to di potato value chain include disease like blight and bacterial wilt, plus poor seedlings. 
According to di National Bureau of Statistics, Plateau State dey among di ten poorest state for Nigeria as dem poverty rate pass 70%.
However, di state get comparative advange to take boost economic activities by improving di competitiveness of di potato commodity value chain.
Di project Coordinator  for di Potato value Chain Support Project, Thomas Muopshin, tok say though di visibility of di tuber crop dey evident for nine local goment area inside Plateau, Na Bokkos and Mangu LGAs be di hub for potato.
Na dem dey produce potato pass any LGA fir di kontri.
However, Muopshin tok say adaptability research indicate say di remainin eight LGA for inside di state also fit plant potato, dat one go make all 17 LGA wey dey for Plateau fit produce tuber, especially for inside dry season.
However, di Association of Potato Farmers (APF) for inside di state, tok say unless dem address di challenge wey dey face di value chain, increase production and export of potato go continue to pass di national. 
Chairman of APF for inside Plateau state, Lazarus Makut, for one interview wey he do wit daily Trust, tok say di inadequate small dam, especially for remote area wia dem dey plant potato, and bad road plus high cost of farm input kontinu to dey affect potato output. 
He tok say di cost of mechanised farmin wey fit increase production quick quick don dey expensive as di majority of farmers na small scale producer wey dey unable to afford mechanization. 
Anoda farmer, wey be Martha Mamgup, wey dey plant potatoe for inside Ampang town for Mangu LGA. tok say water wey no reach durin dry season dey affect potato farmer and harvest dey low evri year.
Bekos of dis, she tok say, di majority of farmers dem search for location of borehole to farm to take access irrigation water for dem farm.
Martha also explain say di high cost of fertilizer dey prevent plenty farmers from improvin quantity plus quality of yield, she add say wen fertilizer no reach, e dey affect di crop output.
Di cost dey also prevent many of us from expandin di business.
So, to get fertilizer no be dey easy for us.
She tok say di construction of more dam plus borehole for irrigation go lead to plenty production of potatoes.
If di watre no reach for di crop, e go dry and e go later die and day na why some farmer wey get di resources dey prefer to dig boreholes for Mangu for irrigation bikos, without am, season farmin go bekom difficult, as she tok.

From Hushpuppi to Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tangâ
Twelve months ago, dem arrest Ramoni Abass (37 years) wey dem know as hushpuppi for June 2020 for Dubai alledge say im do money laundering  from business email compromise fraud and oda scams dem wey dey target firms and one English premier league club.
Di total money wey im make na $435 million afta in dom defraud 1,926,400 victims.
Afta a year,  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also arrest  Abidemi Rufai (wey dem dey call Sandy Tangâ), Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties to Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun for inside John F kennedy Airport, concerning criminal complain say e scam Washington State Employment Security Department of $350,000 (N144,375,000).
Di money wey dem tif na relief money for pandemic wey Washington state design for pipo wey fit don loss dem job bikos of di COVID-19 pandemic.
Na during lockdown di fraud apun and di investigation bureau begin dey track di alleged fraudster wey for be dey make law for Nigeria Federal House of Representative if e no loss di Ijebu North/Ijebu East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency election to Adekoya Adesegun wey be  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) person.
Dem do di fraud by stealing identity of Washington residents wey pass 100 as dm dey fill false claim with di Employment Security Department (ESD) for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.
Dem create new e-mail account for each identity wey dem steal, make dem for identify di claim with different pesin to escape automatic fraud detection system.
After dat, dem don pay pass  $288,000 so im bank account inside America between March and August 2020.
Cybercrime na global threat to pipo, organisation and kontri dem.
Nigeria dey loss pass $128 billion to cybercrimes evri year.
By di time 2021 go end, di world go don loss total of $6 trillion.
Till date, e pass  40 Nigeria pipo wey dem dey or wey FBI  still dey investigate for dem complicity inside fraudulent scams. 
Di allege unemployemnt benefit fraud wey Rufai do go dey under wetin I don call COVID-19 fraud for Nigeria.
Dis na scam wey dey use loopholes wey COVID-19 pandemic don cause to dey scam pipo, goment pr organization dem.
During di COVID-19 lockdown for inside Nigeria, cybercriminals dey do dem frauds along di interventions from goment and private sectors and scamm plenty and some of di  scheme dem  still dey till date.
Domino pizza fraud dey, federal goment cash palliative fraud, N20, 000 Dangote relief fund fraud and promo sales fraud among oda ones.
Wen some dey wey dey cyber-criminality outside Nigeria, some youngster dem dey do am inside Nigeria.
Di Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) dey arrest dem, also try and convict dem. 
To understand di culture wey dey sustain cyber-criminality fit help serious goment to fight di crime.
Di family na di di small worldfor inside di larger society.
Na di place wey dem suppose nuture normal human beign for di society.
Apart from di fact say plenty family for Nigeria dey inside dungeon of poverty and e dey hard to take care of dem children, some of di  children don bikom breadwinners, as e be, e no legit.
Ethical behaviour training for plenty house na challenge as dem don dey arrest parent plus dem children wey dem gather do cyber-criminality.
For some oda places, yahoo boys mama dem dey form association to take celebrate dem pikin success nd justify di criminal thing wey dem do.
For di religious seting, pastors, alfa and traditinalist dey make home and dem dey benefit from yahoo-boyism. 
Moral teachingdon komt for materialistic Pentecostalism to enter.
E get one viral video wia some boys dey spray money while pipo wey be like say dem be shepherd for inside white garment church dey enjoy di captive di moment, as dem member wey di female youth wing of di church dey lead dey record di act of shame.
Pikin wey dem born for 1999 wen Nigeria enter democracy again na 21 years now.
Sadly, dem grow to dey appreciate lie as a way of life from politician dem mouth (and for plenty cases from home) wey dey decieve pipo to vote for dem nd dem no dey fulfil di promise wey dem amke for compaign.
Lying sef na di foundation of di sociology of hushpuppism.
Youth dey socialise daily for inside corruption by pipo dey dey for public office.
Dem dey see how di system dey give farudulent pipo soft landing (for public or private).
Shey dem dey ask how many fraud and corruption allegation wey dem don investigate and discharge wit punishment when di accuse dey guilty? 
Di plenty of cases end wit off-the-mic like as di Nigeria Delta Development Commission (NDDC) case take end like family affair.
Di youth dem dey see as celebrate flamboyant lifestyle inside dirty.
Dem dey see how poor politcal aspirant dey bikom millionaire withing months wey dem enter office.
Dem dey see how traditional institution don bikom cash and carry wen dem dey give chieftancy title.
Tertiary educational institutions, with few exception dem, dey award undeserving honours in exchange for money. 
All of those weu mismanage monet dey get soft landing.
To add to dis list of culture wey dey nuture cybercrime na di lyrical glamour wey some Nigeria musician dem dey give cybercrime as dem dey present cybercrime as work and game wey evribodi dey do and say no be crime.
If we elect fraud pesin enter legislator, e go make law against di crime wey e dey involve?
Di process wey parti leaders dem dey take give parti nomination to di pesin wey get high bid need review if we wan stop to dey import problematic tokunbo things enter awa political system wey don already loss moral.
E dey unfortunate say di critical reasoning of parti leaders dem go low when dem show dem money.
 Dem provide platform for dubious character to take do cover up and di society dey worse with dem action.
Greed dey also cause cyber-criminality.
Di FBI agent wey dey incestigate Rufai, Donald Voiret tok say greed na powerful motivator.
Unfortunately, di greed wey dem allege dis defendant dem dey affect all taxpayer.
To move forward, we no fit dey live inside sin, dey expect grace to abound.
Make Nigeria sanitise dem anti-coruption system and make dem put accoutability policy in place to take track lifestyle with material accumulation.
We must give youth for inside Nigeria hope by creating employment opportunity, reduce poverty plus review reward system dem. 
Di EFCC need to invest inside technology and expose dem detective to modern cybercrime investigation procedure dem.
Di commission need to finish investigation before dem go arrest suspect as FBI do before dem arrest huspuppi and Abidemi Rufai Sandy Tang.
Unless dem tackle di culture wey dey  sustain cybercrimes for inside Nigeria  wit social social engineering, cyber-criminality go kontinu to spread.

How e dey feel to born inside pandemic By Dil Afrose Jahan.
When news of death dey evriwia, one new life bring hapines plus hope
For January 1, 2020, one new morning, two red line change my life.
I get belle and I dey hapi
Na mamzing start to new year.
Na di most remarkable year of my life.
All of a sudden, evriting change.
My daughter Roshomon Tara was born at di end of di first lockdown in Dhaka, Bangladesh; she is now nine months old. I born my pikin Roshomon Tara at di end of di first lockdown for Dhaka, Bangladesh; she don enter  nine months old now.
She be di reason I bekom mother for di middle of global crisis.

For di last mother day, she dey grow inside of me.
Di only thing wey no change, meanwhile, na di pandemic.
Na 16 weeks belle dey inside me when di pandemic apun, and di world enter lockdown.
I be dey struggle to survive di pandemic with my hormonal and physical changes.
Di 22 weeks dem be like war.
My husband, Sina Hasan na musician, and all im concert dey cancelled for dat time.
I be freelance journalist since January 1, 2021.
So we be dey depend on wetin I don save already, and we spend all my savings.
Our parent and two journalists association dem come forward to help for di main time.
I be dey fear evrithing.
Most of di time, e be like say na die

I be dey adapt to new life wey say na online we dey click and dem dey deliver awa things or home-delivery.
I get to dey wait for one week make dem for take deliver groceries like day.
I even dey fear to send di only family member wey dey live wit me, my husband to komot go buy food storage.
So, I no too dey eat.
Beside sef, I no fit go for my antenatal check-up as dem take give me time.
And I be no dey sure if my pikin dey grow welwel abi if development dey take place timely.
I be dey sorry for my unborn pikin say I dey bring am inside world wey different from as e ever be.

Di national question, insecurity and di declaration for inside Asaba.
By Segun Tomori
Recently, governor dem for inside souther Nigeria be meet inside Asaba and dem make some kind resolution on top di state of di nation, which dem don dey call Asaba declaration.
Di meetin dey kom on top di matter as insecurity for di kontri don dey worse, agitation by some kind ethnic jingoist and as di matter murderous herdsmen menace dey generate nationwide attention.
Indeed, di bi-partisan nature wey di meetin get plus di unanimity wey di 17 governor dem display show say dem mean serious business. 
Restructuring inside  di context of true federalism and di ban of open grazing form di koko of di declaration. 
Major light follow be to bring state police, devolution of power, to review revenue formula to take favour federating unit plus di need for national dialogue to take discuss di nation question.
As dem suppose condemn di way gobernos dem dey take drag leg on top financial autonomy for state legislature and judiciary and e no follow di spirit of true federalism which dem dey call for, planty for inside dem resolution na tenet for di ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) wey di committee wey Gov. El=Rufai lead on top true federalism recommend.
One go expect say di leading light for inside APC go take advantage of di bipartisan nature of di Asaba declaration, and di support of di major opposition parti to take begin di process to address di issue.
Instead, we see attempt to take play to di gallery and for some quarter,  subtle censure of di governor dem.
Di El-Rufai committee don recommend devolution of power, resource control, state police, local goment autonomy plus review inside revenue frmula for favour of federatin unit among dem.
President Buhari don give support for local government, state legislature and judiciary autonomy since, as im back amendment for inside di statutes and issue Executive Order 010. 
As di state of di nation take be, wey security and economic don bikom big challenge, na dis two sector dem suppose get di untimate attention togeda.
Despite as dem rate Nigeria as kontri wey get highest GDP for inside Africa, we still neva make better effort wey reach to translate am to take improve standard of living or di majority of awa kontri pipo. 
For instance now, awa annual budget wey reach $35 billion, e dey very inadequate to take cater for di need of 220 million Nigeria pipo. 
South Africa wey get about 58 million pipo get National budget wey reach $75bn for 2019 and her Social Protection Programme reach 17m of im populatiom
Di effort wey di Buhari administration dey make, though na new way and e dey commendable, na just drop for inside ocean and e no dey adequate to make required impact. 
Na here devolution of power and resource kontrol go enter.
Solid minerals and natural resource dem no get any business to stay pass one day inside Exclusive list. 
Almost all di state wey dey di kontri get natural resources wey fit sell market wey dem fit explore to tak create wealth and generate di foreign exchange wey  di kontri need. 
Di present system wia state dey go Abuja to go kolekt federal allocation for inside di kontri dey breed indolence, e no follow di principle of true federalism.
Just as di El-Rufai committee take propose, say make dem review di revenue formula to take favour states since dem go add more responsibilities to dem. 
On top  state police, e dey undesratndable say dem dey fear say governors dem go abuse am, but like Richie Nortondon tok, To escape fear, you have to go through it, not around it.
For too long, we don dey waka round fear of abuse of state police, we don turn blind eye to di centralised Nigeria Police Force wey don dey overstretched and wey don bikom inefficient and big problem.
As vice-President Osinbajo tok some years ago, State Police na idea wey im time don kom.
We have to address awa fears and overcome it.
One for di way na to enact legal instrument to take establish di State Police Regulatory Commission (SPRC), along wit constitutional amendments dem wey go permit state police.
E go dey similar function wit Federal Police Service Commission (PSC) but e go get wider power to take exercise appointive plus regulatory function dem.
Do ban on top open grazing wey di governors dem restate no be nwe thing, e dey part of di fulcrum of di National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) wey National Executive Council (NEC) approve.
Di International Crisis Group (ICG) don put di NLTP as di most comprehensive effort wey Nigeria don make to date to take overhaul di inefficient and grosly underperforming livestock system.
For di core na strategy to take  curb migratory or open grazing and thus lower di risk of conflict between herders and farmersdem, therefore, beggars belief that some myopic, sef-acclaimed ethnic champions choose to lampoon di ban on pre-historic, nomadic open grazing. 
Make  di federal and stae goment move very fast to fully implement dis new plan so we go fit put dis farmers-herders clash wey dey apun fromtime to time behind us.
Di convocation of National Dialogue, wey be major demand of di Asaba declaration fit no dey necessary since report from di 2014 National Conference plus recommendations of di Gov. El-Rufai -led APC committee on True Federalism dey.
Di two report be make far reaching recommendation wey di governor dem wey we elect and dem legislator for inside di national assembly fit agree on, instead of make dem waste resource wey no dey on top anoda jamboree.
On to di issue of separatist agitations dem, make dem bring modalities  to take do referendum as e be inside di constitution.
E dey almost certain say plenty majority of Nigeria pipo wan live togeda, dem no mind awa differences.
To do dis go take di sail komo for di wind of divisive elemnet dem, wey dey fan fire of hate and discord.
di Southern Governor dem don affirm dem commitment to one United Nigeria on top basis of justice, fairness and equity, so must evri patriotic Nigerian.
Though we get challenge dem like evri oda kontri, we must listen to awasefs as US President Joe Bidden dey often tok.
Tomori dey live for Abuja

E neva reach 24 hours afta di new commissioner of police wey dem appoint for inside Anambra, Christopher Adetokumbo Owolabi, resume, na im jaguda pipo attack Obosi Police Station in Idemili North local government area for inside di state and kill two officers.

NEPC, Commonwealth collaborate on  top production of professional service export data
Di Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and di Commonwealth Secretariat London wan collaborate to take produce reliable data on top export for professional service for inside Nigeria.
When e dey tok for di inaugural meeting of di National Consultative Committee for di International Trade-in-Services (NCCITS) wey hold under di Commonwealth Secretariat London, di Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the NEPC, Mr. Olusegun Awolowo, tok say Nigeria no get readily accessible and reliable data on top trade-in-service.

He tok say di Commonwealth don help Nigeria to develop one road-map for di sector for 2016.
Di oga for inside NEPC tok say di current focus for collaboration wit di Commonwealth Secretariat na on top data/statistics collection and management.

However, he admit say apart from di small customers dem wey dem get for Kano, dem no too dey see dem tomato product for local market fpr some kind reason.
First na di fact say di tomato wey dem produce form dem farm na special specie and di second reason be di fact say Jigawa na major area wey dem for dey produce tomato.
You know say tomato na common product for here, so ouw price high small pass wetin dey open market.
So, essentially, pipo no actually dye look awa side, dem dey fell apprehensive wit wetin we get bikos dem believe say e dey cost.
And when you get product wey dey available for evriwia, e sure say pipo go buy di one wey cheap pass.
Na one farm hand dey feed di fish dem.
As dem ask about di average lifespan of dem tomato product, he tok say, if you give di tomato evritin wey e take, i mean say nutrional supplement wey you take feed am as e dey grow, if you give am all of dis things dem, di tomato fit last reach three weeks afta harvest.
But even without am, e go last for minimum of one week, no be for refrigeration, and no be for inside presure and plenty heat.
You fit put am on top table wia better ventilation dey.
E fit last for average of 10 days, but if dem provide evritin as e take require (evri nutrient) e fit last reach one month.
We don experiment am, but then, e no dey apun as you dey always want.

3 Africa pesin, no Nigeria pesin dey among, as City, Chelsea dey contest UEFA Champions League final
No doubt say football fans dem for inside Nigeria dey wait eagerly for di 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League finals wey go apun tonight wey two English clubs dem Manchester City and Chelsea go contest for inside di Estadio do Dragao, Porto in Portugal.
With view of di fact say UEFA Champions League na one of di biggest football competition only next to FIFA World Cup and di Olympic football event, level of expectation don dey increase as giant for inside English Premier League don dey set to fight for di di prestigious diadem.
As Manchestre City neva win Champions league title before, chelsea win dem first and only title for 2012.
Therefore, even as football pundits dem don tip City wey just win premiership number seven to win dis night, Chelsea go enter into di contest wit betta credentials.
Dem be former chsmpion.
However, as Thomas Tuchel wey dey lead technical crew for inside Chelsea neva win Champions league, im opponent for inside Manchester City dugout, Pep Guardiola don win am two times.
He win am with Barcelona for 2009 and for 2010.
Therefore, plenty dey to expect from di actors dem wey go komot enter di field for Estadio.
do Dragao for Porto and di men dem wey go take charge of di technical area. 
Interestingly, even as both contestants get only three African players in Riyad Mahrez (Algeria, Manchester City), Hakim Ziyech (Morococo, Chelsea) and Edourad Menday ( 
Senegal, Chelsea) di interest of Africa for di final don drop. 
For Nigeria here, wia Chelsea and Manchester City dey enjoy plenty followers dem from passionate football fans dem, expection don dey cause fever, and e don lead to interestin realignment.
Fans of di oda clubus wey dem don komot for oda stages of di Champions League do re-align demselve with either Chelsea or Manchester City as dem interest take dey diverse reach.
Di consequence be say di final na one of di topic wey dem dey tok pass for inside sports at di moment and fans of di premiereship club don kontinu to dey predict as di finalresult fit be.
However, as be like say almost evribodi don dey wait to savour the football artistry wey dem fit display, some pundits dem dey as nomba of African players for di final of di biggest football competition for earth don dey reduce.
If we follow history for inside UEFA Champions League, na only 24 African footballer dem don contest and win di trophy with dem European clubs.
E sad say African football  legends like Liberia's George Weah wey dem vote as World Footballer of di year for 1995,
Rashidi Yekini of Nigeria, Mohamed Aboutrika of Egypt, Roger Mila of Cameroon, Jay-Jay Okocha, Sunday Oliseh, Taribo West and Victor Ikpeba of Nigeria, Rigobert Song of Cameroon and Hassam Hassan of Egypt no win Champions League as dem sabi ball reach.
Although Mo Salah (Egypt), Sadio Mane (Senegal), Joel Matip (Cameroon) and Naby Keita (Guinea) dey di big stage when Liverpool be win dem 6th UEFa Champions league title for 2019, di first African wey win di trophy na Bruce Grobbelaar of Zimbabwe.
He achieve di feat with Liverpool for 1984.
Na Algerian legend Rabah Madjer wey win am with FC Porto for 1987 and Abedi Pele (Ghana) for 1993 with Olympique Marseille follow am, before Nigeria 
duo of George Findi and Nwankwo Kanu lift am  with Ajax Amsterdam for 1995.
E also dey record say na Geremi Njitap of Cameroon be di first African to win di title twice in 2000 and 2002 with Spanish giants Real Madrid, Samuel Eto'o of Cameroon kom win am three times with Barcelona 2006, 2009 and 2010 with Inter Milan.
Oda African wey don win di highky coveted trophy na Ibrahim Tanko (Ghana)
Borussia Dortmund 1997, Samuel Kuffour (Ghana) Bayern Munich 2001, Benni McCarthy (South Africa) FC Porto 2004, Djimi Traore (Mali 
) Liverpool 2005, Yaya Toure (Cote d'Ivoire)
Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Seydou Keita (Mali) Barcelona 2009 & 2011, Sully Muntari (Ghana)
Inter Milan 2010 and McDonald Mariga (Kenya) 2010.
John Mikel Obi (Nigeria), Michael Essien (Ghana), Salomon Kalou (Cote d'Ivoire), Didier Drogba (Cote d'Ivoire) wey win am with Chelsea for 2012 and Achraf Hakimi (Morocco), with Real Madrid 2018 complete di list of Africans wey don win di UEFA Champions League.
To come close to home, di last time wey Nigeria pesin win di trophy na 2012 when Mikel Obi dey among AFricans wey lift di trophy with Chelsea at di expense of Bayern Munich.
Afta dat achievement by di former captain of Super Eagles, Nigeria do see oda talented players dem rise, like Ahmed Musa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong, Leon Balogun, Ola Aina, Isaac Success, Chigozie Awaziem, Tyrone Ebuehi, Moses Simon and lately Victor Osimhen
But none of dem don feature for di final of biggest club competition for Europe.
Di reason no dey clear.
Na di di top five club for Europe Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester United and Liverpool dominate di competition.
Unfortunately, Nigeria players dem don fail to enter highly rated clubs dem for Europe.
Na hope of Nigeria football stakeholder say very soon di new generation of players dem go break barrier and begin to play for clubs wey get potential to win di UEFA Champions League.
If dis one fail, den di football fans wey dey for Nigeria go kontinu to dey live with di agony of watchin finakls of di UEFA Champion League dey kom and dey go, without di presence of any Nigeria player.
As Nigeria pipo dey wait for di next Super Eagle player wey go rise to di top of di European club competition di way Find George, Nwankwo Kanu do am with Ajax for 1995 and Mikel Obi for 2012, na few hours remain for di 2021 all English clubs final.
For di end, victory go dey for di Manchester club wey dey hunt for dem first title ot di Londeners wey dey prime for di second itle and di football league wey dem dey watch pass for di world, Premiership go be ultimate winner.

As major force for consumption, na pillar di middle-income group be for di economy.
For present, China get 400 million middle-income earner dem wey dey account for around 30 per cent of dem population.
For kontri dem wey don develop, di distribution of household income dey always come for olive shape form wey dey sharp for di two end and e plump for di middle. 
For oda words, for kontri wey don develop di middle-income group dey usually accpount for 60 per cent go reach 70 percent of di population.
Dem dey consider dat kind structure as say dem dey healthy and good for economic and social development.
In contrast, China way still far to take expand di size of im middle-income group.

Experts dem believe say e dey possible and necessary to put dem for di middle-income group.
Graduates of university and vocational school dem  plenty and are dey well  educated and get skil, wey make am possible for dem to  become middle-income earners. 
Most pipo for dis group, with dem degree of education and competence no go wan do simple and repetive work, so e dey possible say make dem bikom middle-income earners, Su Hainan, wey be contract research fellow with China Association for Labor Studies, tell People's Daily during one interview.
According to di latest statistics from di Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS), China get over 200 million skiled workers wey take 26 per cent of dem total job, up from 20 per cent few years ago.
More dan 50 million of dem be skiled worker.
For recent years, skiled workers no reach for China, and dem income don kontinu to det rise.
Di MOHRSS issue one guideline recently, wey dem encourage enterprises to institute annual salary system and offer special award for skiled talents, esecially di ones wey get high skil.
Su tok say migrant workers na major part of workforce for inside China, many of dem sef dey well educated and dem get skil, and dem no dey able to do complicated and innovative works dem.
Last year, di nomba of migrant worker for inside China reach 280 million, plus 180 wey work out of town.
Di average income wey dem dey get per month stay for 4,072 yuan.
Plenty among dem don dey get close to di threshold of middle income if dem take terms of household calculate am.
To make part of dem imigrant worker to become middle-income earners dey necessary to take marrow di rural-urban income gap, to take improve di competence of workforce and accelerate rural vitalization, and e lso dey feasible to am, as Su take note
As di income of dis major group go rise for future, dem go expand di size di middle-income group for China, dat one go turn di household income distribution to olive shape.  
By dat time, dem go don further actuvate di consumption vitality of China, and di kontri go release more dividends to di world.

One letter to DSS and oda intelligence agencies dem
Una suppose dey smart.
I know say na from police you for evolve just as many oda agency dem. 
As you take komot from di police you suppose clean pass dem, make you smart, make you dey quick for your feet.
Shey na politics come over una?
I hear say di National Security Adviser, Monguno, for di first time since dem appoint am years ago, wey he dey sound very eloquent with im Queen's English.
Make dem polish am, afta all im na one of dis ajebutter Nigerian wey get priviledge to attend Kings College back in di day.
From im speech I dey hear and I dey see one mind wey dey organised and intelligent, functional brain, and i wonder why and how Abba Kyari take manage to cage dat kain pesin and Buhari dey look.
Munguno later go on to allege say plenty inside di arms wey Nigeria pay for under di recent military chiefs wey don turn ambassador na im dem no fit find.
When im see say dem don dey ruffle feathers, im try to walk back wetin dem allege say im tok.
Some few days afta dat apun, we hear di news say Buhari be stop some weapon acquisition wey he wan make from Dubai through third parti dem.
Di report put Monguno for bad light and e wan expose im hypocrisy.
Shey we go ever get way to komot for inside dis insecurity maze?
We no longer dey hear from di leadership for inside DSS.
Afta di initial gra-gra and controversy dem don silent.
No one dey hear or dey see Yusuf Bichi anymore, but we dey see smart DSS chaps dem inside dark suits ad goggle wey dey do dem bodiguard service to di high and mighty.
We even dey see dem on top few occasion wey dem go dress like ninja, dem go complete like balaclavas plus some out-of-this-world machine guns dem.
But na there e for end.
E be like say di president no care about di efficacy of DSS and so dem sef don jejely withdraw enter dem cocoon.
Some politics dey go on for there.
Di police, we sabi dem problem; that one don tey.
I  don dey write so I no go draw attention of dis bodi dem kom my side
But well I go dey available for dem attention if dem take am personal.
I dey write as concerned citizen of Nigeria.
I dey fear say intelligence no dey for dis kontri anymore.
I dey prompted to write specifically bikos di nation don drift totally and even as we accuse politician say dem don sleep, no excuse for awa intelligence services dem to dey snore too.
E dey be like say dem don abandon Nigeria for di hand of element like kidnapper, secessionist, fake news agent dem, online terrorist, plus oda form of terrorist.
Who no know say security for di level of intelligence don loss?
wiaas Nigeria don kom disrespect di police, but many still dey fear di intelligence service dem seek of say we dey see dem as elite corps.
At least dem no fit see dem for road dey kolekt money from bus drivers dem.
However, pesin fit confirm say wit di rifeness of crime, di way di society don dey fall apart, di intelligence service don loss dem bite and famed prowess, especially for inside dis goment. 
How one group wey no get face wey dem name FUNAM dey plant dat kind plenty wahala for inside Nigeria society and we get intelligence service wey dey komot eye?
Whoever e be wey dey put statement out for FUNAM dey play small pikin play for inside di mind of Nigeria pipo but even professor dem dey believe dem.
Dis one na bikos, for di end, for dis kontri we dey very emotional.
However, di intelligence service don komot eye as if say dem no see as all dis things dem dey go on.
I google statement by FUNAM so I go fit get some direct quote for dis article and one statement from 2018 pop komot
wiain na dis same FUNAM claim say Nigeria na dem only inheritance and say di whole of Nigeria go reach di Atlantic na dem get am, say Plateau na dem indigenous territory, even as dem dey claim say na dem do some bad bad kilin dem. 
For recent times, di same group claim say na dem attack Benue Governor Ortom, and only dem no see am kill bikos of some kind small error for communication.
Di group further tok am say dem intension no get doubt: TO KILL AM.
Dem go fulfil di mission one day and e go dey very soo too.
Furthermore, we warn pipo wey dey collabo to take work against Fulani pipo for inside Nigeria: WE GO GET YOU NO MATTER WIA YOU HIDE
We tok am clearly, we go confront any state or individual wey dey oppose RUGA
Any State or individual that opposes ranching, we shall get you.
Speak against ranching or RUGA even for internet: awa fighters dem wey no dey make noise go find you and dem go fix you
For di next few month wey go follow, FUNAM go attack some strategic human and material assests for inside states and non state group dem or individual wey we know say dem dey do anti Fulani campaign. We go hunt you down for your house, for your wrk place, inside your car, for your street.
a matter of time.
Pipo sign dis document but dem neva catch any person, and awa intellingence serveice dem neva declare say na fake.
From my own humble perception dis satement dem be like pikin tok, wey pesin wey dey look for wahala, wey wan make pipo vex, wey wan cause disunity write. 
Di statement also take eye away from di real pipo wey dey do di bad.
I be don dey on top plenty WhatsApp group dem wey I dey try to calm pipo down and bring dem attention say dem dey manipulate dem mind.
But why I dey do work wey DSS suppose do?
Even Ortom don call press conference before wia im for read anoda statement wey di group put for online to di extent say Benue state na dem own and dey e dey sweet dem to kill Tiv pipo dem!
Plenty Nigeria pipo don dey hail Ortom say im na governor wey love im pipo on top im public show dem.
However, dem must catch pipo wey attack am. 
We hear say police don catch some fishermen for inside di area.
I don dey careful as dem put evri crime for Nigeria on top herders dem.
Shey no be say we dey give oda criminals dem space to ride on top awa sentiment?
Shey wetin we dey tok be say with all resources dem wey awa intelligence service dem get, pesin no dey wey fit find di pipo wey dey dump things for online, wey dey stew up di mind of Nigerians, wey dey kos wahala evriwia and wey dey get pipo prepare for war or make nation scatter?
Shey na di best wey we fit do be dis gentlemen?

(II) Why secession no be di silver bullet to di problem wey Nigeria get (II)
Di pipo wey dey do say make Nigeria break up put am on top three main reason dem; di amalgation of northern and southern protectorate for 1914 wey born Nigeria, di charter of sef determination for inside United Nation plus lack of representation and marginalisation for inside di affairs of di kontri.
The mind say na di amalgamation of 1914 wey secessionist group dey say be di foundamental move wey cause plenty inside di current challenge dem wey dey face Nigeria need make dem challenge welwel and debunk am totally.
For dis regard, e go benefit us to know say amalgation be don apun earlier for 1906 wia dem merge di Lagos colony wey don dey since 1862 wit southern protectorate.
Like di 1914 amalgamation wey follow wey dey enervate di secession pipo dem, di amalgamation wey apun for 1906 too na force dem take do am between entity dem wey no dey willing and dem get little or no cultural similarity.
Wetin di pipo of costal state for inside Niger Delta region get culturally and historically wit Yoruba pipo of southwest?
Wetin be di historical and cultural link wey di Igbo wey dey for east hinterland get wit Yoruba for dat matter?
 As far as we fit see am, di reason to take reject di amalgamation of 1914 go reach for di one of 1906 on top say na force dem force di two against pipo wey get different history and culture.
Why secession pipo dey only tok about di 1914 amalgamation to take press dem demand and dem dey neglect di one wey apun for 1906?
Di reason dem dey simple bikos for dem own narrow political tok wey dey try justify North vs South secessionist agenda na di 1914 amalgamation enter am pass.
E no go form beta strategy if dem dey also tok about di amalgamation wey dey essential, by import and effect, and e dey similar to di one wey apun for 1914.
How e go take look for instance if Oduduwa secessionist tok say na bikos of si amalgamation for 1906 di Igbo wey get different history and culture don kom dominate di economic and commercial life inside Lagos and as such di Oduduwa dey seek to komot for di marriage with Igbo wey di British pipo be force on top dem.
or di Igbo dey say na di amalgamation of 1906 kos the bad nature of economic infrastructure wey dem concentrate put for Southwest wey dey carry dem (Igbo) kom invest for Lagos economic zone rather than di East wey go dey convienient pass?
Anoda falacy wey dem carry concerning di 1914 amalgamation be wey Nigerian entity dem represent sign be say e supoose expire afta hundred years wey mean say na 2014.
Say Nigeria still dey exist afta im expiry date na somethingg wey secessionist dem still dey try to instigate oda Nigeria pipo against and make sure say dem end of dis joinjoin wey don expire as dem dey call am.
Again dis one na near tok wey no get leg.
By 1914 di British don get full and total kontrol of di territory wey we dey cal Nigeria now and all di entities as dem be don dey under British rule.
Dem don establish di British colonial rule on top Nigeria and na dat one make di amalgamation pure administrative measure by colonial overload wey im no need permision from im subject to carry am out.
For this regard di amalgamation no fit get time to expire as dem dey claim, and e no get.
If time ever dey for di amalgamation to take expire as dem dey claim, e suppose be for di end di British colonial enterprise wey be say at di same time no be British go determine am.
If any genuine document dey wey carry di terms and condition of di 1914 amalgamation wey include pipo wey represent various pre-existing Nigerian entities plus clause wey dey state di clause for di expiry, na di work od di pipo wey dey pray for Nigeria to break up to present am as proof.
For any case, even if such document dey, as Nigeria take get independence for 1960 e no go dey valid again bikos na evri entity for Nigeria dey take part wit di representative wey dem elect to take discuss and agree on top di new kontri.
If di kind agreement wey dem dey carry about di amalgamation dey anywia and if di parti dem wey follow tok about di independence agree to retain am and dem include am inside di independence constitution, e for don bikom relevant constitution and legal case for di secession entity to take cite dem agitation.  
On top di issue of di UN provision on sef-determination as dem take cite am for dem secession action, e dey important make dem get two important point for mind.
Di UN no be world goment wey get executive power to take stamp dem will on top national goment dem.
Kontri fit use di principle of sovereignty to take block any resolution wey UN make if dem see say e no follow dem national interest.
Although Nigeria follow sign to di UN charter wey di provision of sef-determination follow, e fit and dem get right to block attempt from any group withing wey wan break di kontri if dem use dat provision.
Thus even as e dey unlike say any group break away from Nigeria and UN support am, Nigeria fit use dem sovereign right to stand against such move.
But di thing wey dey more significant be say although di UN charter dey providde sef detrmination, di UN don place great onus to take seek dem credential and case comprehensively.
Di process to take ssek and to eventually get di support of UN for sef-determination bid dey very complicated and covoluted one wey fit take year to set and e still fit no get success at di end.
Those seeking to invoke di UN principle of sef-determination for dia secessionist bid must first of all prove say dem get di mandate of di pipo of di area dey seek to represent through popular elections or referendum and not through di media or internet. Di pipo wey dey try to evoke UN principle of sef-determination for dem secessionst bid must firts prove say dem dey do wetin pipo for di area wey dem dey represent want wit popular election or referendum no be through media or internet. 
Dem must to show proof say di area wey want do secession dem don dey deny dem or say dem no get adequate representation for local, state and national level of di goment of di kontri.
We go conclude am next week
Lebanon don start dem COVID-19 vaccination drive, PM tok say im go wait for im turn.
Lebanon be start dem COVID-19 vaccination drive for Sunday as dem take inoculate di head for critical care unit for dem public hospital wey big pass, na di 93-year old Lebanese actor plus comedian wey pipo celebrate Salah Tizani follow am.

Reason why Katsina farmers dem record poor harvest
Zobo farmer for Katsina State don record decline for product even as small rain fall dey dis year
Di farmers tok say di poor harvest na as bikos of di absence of affordable fertiliser from di beginnin wey rain season and invasion of dia farm by di herdsmen wey kom from Niger Republic
Dey kom dey lament continue say di relocation of some of dia market and lack of goment support dey part of dia major challenge dis year
Dey kom observe say di heavy rain wey fall, wey dem record toward end of season no favour di roselle plant, e no make dem grow to dia usual height, wey go don enable am to produce seed wey good wey fi produce zobo
farmer wey dem sabi wella Malam Abdullahi Kwangwama
Malam Abdullahi Kwangwana, wey be zobo farmer for Mani Local goment Area for di state,  for wan interview wey Daily Trust do, tok say from di beginnin of last season na hin manure or fertiliser to apply to plant no dey, situation wey slow down hin growth
Malam Kwangwama tok say,we no get any fertiliser from goment truout di season, and na dat one make am difficult for plant grow early
Di  small bag wey we fi buy for market for N12,000 per bag kom late and e no fi help grow high reach chest, wey e dey normally high reach so tey e go fit produce plenti seed
No too plant plenti food crop dis year
And I only fit harvest 60 bag of hibiscus dis season, against 85 bag wey I get last year
I get two wife and eight pikin, six of dem dey school, and na di only hope wey I get to feed dem and to dey pay dia school fee
goment wan support us to dey produce zobo for commercial quantity for domestic use for Nigeria and export, wetin dey need do na to make adequate plan to provide plan for di provision of fertiliser for cheap price and support farmer to dey access loan wey no get interest wey fi allow us hire pipo, kom cultivate more farmland
Na bikos say buyers dey always wait for produce, and wey dey to do well
Di roselle seed coat or cover na hin dem dey use produce d popular zobo juice for Nigeria, wey dey consider use for di treatment of stomach pain, high blood pressure, weight loss, among odas
For some kontri, dem dey use am for tea production, colourin, dyein, drug production and bicosmetic
anoda farmer and merchant of zobo, Ali Makeri, complain say one of di challenge wey dem face na di relocation of di market by di authority of Mashi Local goment Area, wey am tok say e dey affect patronage
Accordin to am, di market don relocate plenti time to different place, wey far from Mashi main market
Hin later tok say even if we pay revenue to di local goment kom create job for ova five time dem dey relocate us from one bushy area to anoda
Once wey dem discover say we don settle, kom develop one particular place, dey go don kom ovanight kom take us go anoda place wey neva open
Di last one na for dis year wen dey bring us kom here, close to di Mashi Ultra Modern Market
E dey far from di main market and awa customer dey fear to kom here, for security purpose
Therefore, we dey beg di chairman make he reason wit us and make he give us permanent and convenient place wey go dey close to di main market because most of our customers kom from different parts of di kontri; and dey go dey comfortable if we dey close to di main market.
On top di mata say whether zobo farmer for Katsina State get di capacity to produce large quantity for export, Makeri tok say; why dey no fit
Na hundreds of man and woman wey be hibiscus farmer dey for Katsina State bikos say e dey bring moni.
Last year alone, we sell am for N8,000 per bag from di beginnin, and for some point, e reach N20,000 per bag
wetin we need na support
If goment fit attract investor here and dey kom build factory wey fit supply us wit fertiliser, equipment and loan to hire more pipo, I fit assure you say we go generate more revenue for Nigeria
anoda farmer, Malam Yusuf Gwani Gobirawa for Kaita Local goment Area complain say herdsmen from neighbourin Niger Republic invade dia farm before dey fi finish harvest dis year

You no say wetin we dey depend on pass na local manure from awa domestic cattle
But now, we no fit carry awa animal comot from home

holocaust wey we no fit forget
derfore, I tok ( Jesus) to una (Jew), di kingdom of God na hin dem go collect from you, and dem go give am to nation wey dey bring forth di fruit 
And di lord go bring una ( Jews) inside Egypt again wit ship and
for der, dem go sell una give una enemies and no man go buy una
Now will him ( di Lord) remember dia (Jews) iniquity, kom visit dia (Jews) sin dey (Jews) go return go Egypt
To dey read di three passage for New and Old Testament wey dey Bible, person go get di impression say World Jewry get di difficult task wey turn away wetin Bible scholars aptly tok say na second bondage
Di reflect for Israeli response to di slightest of provocations, weyalso go to remind us from di parable of wan man wey dey kpeme wey refuse to godown alone
Di stage for di current slaughter for di Middle East dey lay wen di world to show respect for di 75th anniversary of di so call holocaust last year
Afta di wetin resemble entente cordiale wey follow di event, and even before pictures from Auschwitz and Jerusalem disappear from television screens, den American President wey wicked, Donald Trump, release one Middle East Peace Plan that virtually wey carry di modest progress wey dey don make for restive region for square one back.
If Trump successor, President Biden get plan to resolve di crisis wey dey Middle East, him neva wan show am
so far, Mr Biden dey satisfy to stick to di wrong head plan him inherit from Trump
whateva wey di case be, e dey careless for Mr Biden to play down di holocaust wey dey go on to occupy Palestine for di epidemic excuse wey Israelis don fight to defend dia sef
for one all swoop, Mr Biden don behave typically  by wittin shreddin di Oslo Camp David Accords
Biden plan wey him no advertise, which morbidly fits into Trump final solutionâ, means say Palestine wey occupy go still get hin ignoble status as one big prison wer eviction of Palestine pipo and dia land dem wey dey turn dia own go continus , pari passu, as dem dey kil dem witout control.
 E dey di queer belief say di only good palestinian na di dead one
since Israel officially kom inside 1948, di unadvertise gaol for stiff neck Jewish leader and dia clappers don go shatter di alleged record wey be record wey Adolf Hitler set
And , strangely, complicit world kip Israel goadin
All dis dey kom for time wey world power claim say dem dey increase kom unite against forces of terror and darkness
Hypocrisy dey increase and as usual, America and di West dey bask for dia warp victory
bakin from wan direction, backin Trump unregenerate policy, hawkish Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who kontri don dey responsible for most of di violence for di World
But di culture of silence don neva always infectious
for di order of di divide na Iran and Few Muslim and Palestinian Organisation wey don dey consistent for dia condemnation of wetin dey consider di annual ritual commemoration of hollow kos
As e dey always apun, dey don get dia shrill cry of condemnation drown for global display of hypocrisy
for under normal mata, any act of great destruction and loss of life, like genocide ( for Rwanda), ethnic clean(for Bosnia Herzegovina and for Myanmar)
Apathy(for white monority rule South Africa) and di senseless Jewish dicriminatory practice (for occupy Palestine) qualify for wetin dem dey call holocaust
Strangely, di word holocaust render hollow for hin restrict application as e dey exclusive and hypocritically, employ to refer to di alleged incineration of six Jew for concentration camp
e fi be Adolf Hitler dey wrong but di way di decendant of hin alleged six million victim behave for di middle east, e dey tempt pesin to ask, for di risk to dey dub anti-Semite; shey Hitler dey right
Dis question go continue to dey excite  for view of di unspeakable and despicable atrocities wey Jews commit for Palestine wey dem occupy.
small wonder wey even wit effort to criminalise holocaust, Palestinians and dia American and European sympathimer desist from criminalisin and aimalisin Adolf Hitler
No holocaust or final solution go eva work
and di proof of dis fit find successive Israeli offensive for occupied Palestine wey lay bare di vunerability for di overrated Israeli Defence Force IDF
If to say, whateva air of invincibility di IDF enjoy don evaporate for di face of resistence from Hamas and Hezbollah(Hizbullah parti of God) and oda anti-occupation groups
As world power continue to turn blind eyes, extremist group, many of dem wey di United State train to contain Soviet expansion don grab di initiative
di struggle for di creation of Israel no be tea parti or na e dey born di state by United Nations resolutions
instead, e kom from di barrel of di gun
na di bombin spree of dem Jewish jaguda pipo organisation na e led to di creation of Israel for 1948
Dey don tell Palestine say dem no get beta option dan to fight
wetin be di reason
America Middle  East policy provide d tonic dey need to fight 
in fact, for Evri Hamas and order milliant Palestine group di world wey we know today, di Jews get dia jaguda pipo Irgun and Zvai terror machine
dem dey do wetin dem do for  Palestine wetin Zvai and Irun do for Israel for di early part of di 20th century
as good student of history, Hamas and ally radical Palestinian group dey aware say no amount of hour wey dem spend around table go give dem house
if palestine fail to copy dia fightin Jew cousin of di early and mid 20th century, dey suppose just forget Palestine homeland
make di world continue to dey believe say Palestine dey unform pipo and continue to see Jew as special breed
e dey fine
No be even di mata of say some wastern kontri see holocaust denial as major crime and dey kom refuse to dey apply di word to victim of Israel disciminatory practice against dia Palestine cousin
wetin mata for di end of di day na di amount to hollow kos to glorify one holocaust and kom turn di blind eyes to anoda

Di rice pyramids don return for di kontri
Di maize pyramid don return too
Dis dem pyramid don dot di skylines for state like Kebbi, Niger, Katsina, Jigawa, Ekiti, and di rest
for oda like Lagos, Edo, River and di rest, CBN finance industry dey wey dey maximize di farm produce to make somethin
Remember say di pyramid dem dey dat time lose for Nigeria until di Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) wey Mr Godwin Emefiele dey lead, initiate new focus on top agriculture, industries, small and medium scale enterprise dem and oda area of di real sector.
Adults for Nigeria wey still young wey dey for dat kind 30years neva see any agriculture produce pyramids until wey e no tay wey CBN make ham apun
Wen CBN launch di Anchor Borrower programme ABP for five year wey we don use comot, e no for true anticipate di scale of success di programme go record and di impact across di kontri
Five years wey we don use pass, Nigeria agricultue landscape don change from good and e no get region or state wey dey behind
E dey significant to note say di benefit don almost distribute from di north to di south pass N700 billion wey dey don release for di target crop and animal, and dia value chain
As he dey tok recently for Ado Ekiti for di public unveilin of the Ekiti rice pyramid project and flag-off of di wet season rice cultivation, di CBN Governor, Mr Emefiele, tok say ova N300bn of di moni wey almost reach N700bn wey dey don already distribute on top agriculture, dey don share am for di southern part of country includin Lagos, Edo, Ekiti, and Ondo state dem.
Hin tok say 21 agriculture commodity na e dey target pass di rest wey be Rice, maize, wheat, oil palm, cocoa and di rest
He tok say;From di beginnin till date, we don give 3,107,890 farmers moni for di cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodity through 23 Participatin Financial Institutions for di 36 State of the Federation and FCT.
Emefiele tok say dem fit see di positive impact of di Anchor Borrower Programme or all ourr agrarian community as e don bring hope kom di farmin population through di timely delivery of agricultural inputs and di provision of  market wey get guarantee for dia outputs for price wey di market go determine. 
Hin tok say ABP don fit support some of awa macro economic objective as to dey allow employment opportunity wey dey drive financial inclusion and to dey provide access to finance for awa rural community
For under 2020 wet season RIFAN CBN partnership, hin tok say CBN finance 221, 450 farmer for di cultivation of 221,450 hactare for 32 state
Di pyramidswey dem open today dey part of di harvest from di different field from di South-West and oda neighbourin States to demonstrate di spread of di movement and provide evidence say rice production dey viable for all di State wey dey di Federation.
hin tok say pass RIFAN, CBN support number of prime/private anchor
Omoluabi farm( Ekiti), time seller(Ogun), Wems Agro(Ondo) and di rest dey wait disbursement for 2021 season
CBN big support for agriculture na to ensure say food dey sufficient, empowerment for dem small farmer and to dey help save foriegn exchange for Nigeria as small food import dey apun
CBN don continue to carry up investment for di agriculture space
E don start di 2021 wet season farm investment
Emefiele tok say we get optimistic outlook for di 2021 wet season
We go bring to bear our learnin experience ova di past years, adoption of hybrids dem and high yieldin varieties dem, supply of inputs wey go dey on time to take advantage of di plantin seasons dem, and good market linkage use sustain our effort to dey increase production.
We don plant minimum one million hactares of rice through combination of RIFAN farmer and prime/private anchors for each plantin seeason for 2021
awa backward integration dey drive wit rice millers e dey also gain momentum as we intend to finance some millers to grow dia own paddy for dis wet season
He tok say; We get aggressive production plans for maize, wheat, soybeans, cassava, sorghum and cassava, 
Di governor sef indicate say di CBN go dey hep states wit moni to clear land as land clearin na big problem for farmin.
Land clearin, access for irrigation, and availability of high yieldin seeds don remain di greatest challenge to increase agricultural production for di South and we don provide long term finance option dem wey go dey give more land for agricultural production nationwide.
Dem create di Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (AADS) and di Private-Sector Led Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (P-AADS) say make dem solve dis issue for di State Goment and Private Sector players respectively.
He tok say; Di provision of oda farm wey relate to di infrastructure like irrigation facilities, rural access road, mechanization services, logistics and post-harvest handlin activities fit dey under dis intervention. 
He tok sef say if farmers pay dia loans, CBN fit put hand for more areas thus urgin di farmers wey benefit from the loans make dem pay back.
Loan repayment na di hallmark of every credit wey pipo collect and the sustainability of di programme dey on top farmers ability and willingness to repay dia loan, and we dey engage dem wella wit dem to increase dia trust for di system.
The pyramid dem wey dey unveil  today na harvests from di financed fields dem wey dem been submit as part of loan repayment by farmers dem under di RIFAN-CBN programme.
He tok say;To further create value and transfer dis gain across di value chain, we don map rice millers wey go dey off-take di paddies, and we go track di release of dia outputs to di market, as we dey strive to manage inflation and grow di rice value chain in Nigeria. 
To support di growth wey dem record for dis drive to attain self-sufficiency for food production and to moderate price dem of agricultural commodities, Mr President don approve di resuscitation of di Nigeria Commodity Exchange (NCX).
A vibrant commodity exchange enhance post-harvest handlin, guarantee effective pricin for farmers dem, minimize di adverse effect of middlemen and commodity hoarders and ultimately transfer to gains from primary production  oda nodes of di value chain.
Considerin di kind huge market and high population of Nigeria wit di urgent nid to end poverty, it don successfully demonstrate di nid to luk inside by takin advantage of di available fertile land, perennial river bodies and human resource dem for di production of rice.
Di first two year of di programme(2015 reach 2017) record significant increase for rice production wit decrease for rice importation
For example to dey carri rice kom kontri from Thailand fall 644,131 metric tone for September 2015 to 20,000 matric tone for September 2017, wish account for drop pass 90%
Di success so far record dey possible bikos of di Anchor borrowers program wey Federal goment introduce for conjunction wit di Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) dat one no not only improve rice production but don also enhance di quality through de-stoning.
 hin tok say; E don see di increase for di number of local rice mills
He tok say federal goment share di moni to di Anchor and in conjunction wit di participatin States, for land clearin, provision of seeds for plantin, inputs like  knapsack sprayers, tube wells, pumpin machines, ploughs, combined harvesters, rice millin machines and production lines, packagin na hin dey provide.
Furthermore, analysis of di ABP programme show say funds wey dem provide for low interest make am possible: easy access to rice farmers dem; economies of scale as plenti of farmers na hin dem enlist into di programme; enhance di rice value chain in form of finance for primary producers go processors “ handlers “ wholesalers “ storage “ marketin (branding) “ export; improvement of farmers dem fortunes; and employment generation.
Di remainin na food sufficient, so tey poverty banish and insecurity, generation of revenue as farmer go pay tax and improvement for economy as naira gain value
Hin kom note say di ease of production of rice wey be di staple wey get value pass for Nigeria don successful practice and celebrate for some state like Kebbi, Jigawa, Sokoto, Niger, Kwara, Ebonyi
E dey grate say today , Ekiti State don now join di train as participant for di Anchor Borrowers Programme of di CBN, wey dey partnership wit National bodi Rice farmer Association of Nigeria wey Anchor Borrower lead
Bode George describe constitution review as charade
former Deputy National Chairman of di pipo Demcratic paryi (PDP)Chief Olabode George, don describe di constitution review wey dey go  by di National Assembly as charade
Hin tok say di position wey dey unanimous of di Nigeria pipo na total overhaul of di present constitution addin, nothin else go do
Accordin to am, genuine remedy make dem go check di report of di 2014 Constitutional Conference again, wey he note say dey don generally applaud sake of di sweepin breadth of hin equity and democratic balance to correct di prejudicial and unworkable structures wey dey ground now.
For one open letter to  Senate President, George fault di process of di constitution review wey dey go on, especially di public hearin wey apun last week, as he note say plenti pipo na hin dey purposely deny di openness of democratic contributions.
Hin tok say di hearing dey stage manage, anchored for prejudice, frame for puppeteerin indentification
Alternative view na e dey cast aside, fling inside pit
Dis one no correct
Dis no dey just
e really dey show say di Committee no dey ready  for true and thorough representation wey be di will of Nigeria pipo
e appear say to dey work wit script near predetermined end
di contribution dey narrow, over partisan, one side, lackin for plural contribution logic
Nigeria pipo no dey gree am
Di structure of di present contitution too get ojoro, e get flaw and e dey mingle wit inequities, he say mare review no go dey enough to correct all di glarin wrong wey dey afflict Nigeria state
PDP leader tok say as a believerfor di unity of di Nigerian state, he tok say di nation fit emerge stronger and better only wen all di component units form our nation fit get sense of belongingness and general accommodation wey em no go dey look tribe or sectarian belief, wen evribodi  go be di same witout ethnic bias, wen merit na di sole determinant of public positions.
We fit only achieve am wit dem pipo and constitution
Na wetin we suppose work for be dis instead charade and present jamboree wey Senator Ovie omo Agege 
 E don do for all dis false and misleadin engagement
Make we renew awa nation through as we dey pursuit di truth and resolve on di fairness doctrine
Dia in reside di national salvation; hin add
Wan love letter wey dem write give Mallam Nasir el-Rufa
I been don make my mind up to write give you openly before I see di viral video by Dr Shadi Sabehwey dey beg you do wetin you wan d wit human feelins regardin di 20,000 staff of the Kaduna State Goment wey you propose to sack.
I too agree wit Dr Sabeh say pipo say make dem kip pipo for service just to play dem as social service
Nigeria no fit afford am now
awa Economy no dey develop 10th as US economy take be
Na 1930s wen e go through di Great Depression
Howeva, Dr Sabeh dey right to extend say Keynesianism don back world ova and goment must necessary think about di impact of hin policy on di pipo wey hin dey service
We know say for Nigeria, goment unfortunately no  believe say dey kom here kom serve di pipo, but na awa duty to work togeda to change dat unfortunate misunderstandin and disconnection
E get oda issue wey dey kom from Kaduna state presently
For true di state under your goment dey don again mention am as one of di best governed and we hear of your achievement for infrastructural development
Di danger to dey travel to Kaduna don hamper many of us to kom see dem achievement, but most pipo know say El-Rufai na man of achievement and stickler for standards
Di Federal Capital Territory(FCT) no fit forget you in hurry
plenti pesin rue your absence as minister

Unfortunately, plenti of di village wey you clear and plenti of di shanties wey you demolish don kom back dis time wit vengeance
wetin?
Di goment over time don make no plan for dis poor folks, and human being  like water and must find dia level
If u dey fly go Abuja for any point for time, make you look down from di window of your aeroplane and u go see how bad shanties don metastasize since you don comot
Any minister wey go try and correct dis anomaly go get millions of dem refugees for hin hand
for your time, na 500,000 refugees we don get
For 2006, Nigeria get di second highest number of displace pipo for di world afta wey Iraq due to hin action
I remember say I write give you den through my Daily Trust column, dey appeal for di same thin wey Dr Sabeh dey call for human face
I quote timeless Chinese wisdom as dey remind you your vision na one year, kom cultivate flowers
If na 10, cultivate trees
But if na eternity, cultivate human
Di idea den na say make e go easy on you hard rhetoric say anyone wey dey earn less  dan N50,000 make e return to village, bikos Abuja no dey for di poor
You tok say dis na national TV and e dey unfortunate and unfeelin
Na for sure say most bourgeoisie thin wey pesin don eva tok for office
If anybodi wan lay claim say Abuja be dia inheritance, e for be dose Gwaris wey dem displace from dia ancestral land, plenti time witout compensation
For what point Abuja bikom playground/inheritance for di nouveau riche
As we dey watch TV for 2006, families wey no get place to stay inside rainy season, wit dia mattress on dia head and dia little pikin for dia hand, we hear di storie of pipo wey kil diasef bikos both dia house and dia business na hin dey destroy di same day.
I learn from one lady, who dey act as secretary to some of your meetin dem dat time , how you take enjoy displacin dose poor pipo at once, how Drs Oby Ezekwesili and Okonjo-Iweala dey beg you no change your mind and dem use style call you sadist as you comot for di meetin go demolish anoda place.
E sound much like di folks dem for di south of di USA wey dey take joy to dey hang demsef anoda negroa
Kaduna no only get bloat civil service but also problem wit indiscriminate buildin of all kind structure wia dey suppose be like Evri wia for Nigeria
Abuja claim to get master plan which no one suppose see, derfore making am political plan no be geographical one
Kaduna no be Abuja, and di pipo wey dey der fi no get di mettle to sand Hurricane Nasir, as we take do here for Abuja till 2007 under your Iron grip
You know say u fit easily craze wen dey turn you on
You confess am yoursef
You no care which pesin ox dem kill and dis fit be good attribute to turn like our kontri around , but e fit dey deadly for plenti plenti poor folks, especially for Kaduna wey be simply agrarian and civil service state.
Compensation go dey for example dose one wey u go demolish dia house and shop
Anyone dey hear dia tor iof how dey kom about di land or space or dey don tell dem to go back hell?
Na True say make we strive to achieve glistenin city in in oda to achieve accolades from far and near, no to mind di human coasts
Make goment calibate solely to appeal to di whim and fancies of di moni class
look Banana Island and Turnbull Street for Ikoyi
Di oda day, di well feed owners of property der push one video wia dey fiilm how dia pristine space don encroach by poor invader
E remain small make dem call di poor pipo as vermin
Di pipo no be di invader but lack of integrated, inclusive plannin
As educated wey we claim be, we no choose to learn di nuance lessons from di place wey we visit for abroad
How anybodi fit think say di model of Banana Island go work foreva wen provision no dey on how servants, drivers, gardeners and oda low pipo weey dey dis oga for mansion dem go survive; how dem go eat dia lunch, how them go live and sleep close to wer dey suppose resume for 4am evri day?

One of di EV offerin wey dem just reveal na di Nissan Ariya
Dis na high tech electic SUV wit 310 mile range

Di company for hin last statement, say di Ariya na di ultimate expression of style and technology

Di slim profile Zero Gravity seat dey hep provide additional legroom for both front and back seat passenger
Di Ariya EV platform make am easy for dem engineer to free up cabin space for unique ways, as to dey mount di climate control system under di hood wia combustion engine go don be
Transmission tunnel no dey necessary wit Evs and di Ariya flat floor dey generate plenti passenger and cargo space
Verily na time to ask for help
Sake of dia accomplishments ova di years, many readers not fit really understand  wetin apun to di military for di last many years, particularly as e dey affect di fight against di Boko Haram insurgents, bandits and di insolent kidnappers dem.
awa military don get distinguish record for di field startin for regional and international peace kipin
For independence for 1960 wen we join di United  Nations, we don immediately start to contribute awa armed force personnel to peace kipin efforts
Dem tok say awa troop don acquit dimsef creditable for Congo 1960-64, Tanzania 1960-62 and Pakistan 1965-66
By di time wey awa civil war break out for 1967, awa troop don already get fightin experience wey fi don kom to help crush well armed and determin secessionist movement for mere 30 month
afta, dis prowess  of awa troop make dem dey very sought afta by di United Nation weneva and wiaeva conflict dey, to contribute to peace kipin force and international military contribution
awa troops don serve Evriwia
For 1978 we dey Lebanon as part of UNFIL, Chadfor 1981, wit Iraq border UNIMOG for 1988, Kuwait UNICOM for 1991, Angola 91, Namibia 89, Cambodia 92, Yugoslavia 92 
Na true near home for Sierra Leonne and Liberia, awa troop and di resource Nigeria commit make di difference for those kontris to fall apart or to remain intact
For 2007 dis kontri dey position wet we fit get confidence for di ability of our Army as force wey strong, say hin be voiced opposition to AFRICOM, one combatant command wey USA create to dey watch ova Al Qaeda and oda terrorists operations for Africa.
Di USA back down to dey establish di command post for Africa soil, bikos Nigeria,  South Africa and Libya voice dey loud opposition to di plan
In fact, Nigeria too dey belligerent for hin opposition say di goment tok tok pesin tok say we no only reject AFRICOM for Nigeria soil but also e no go wan see am for Africa kontri dem
Di  rejection dey loud and clear and di US gats accede, make dem allow AFRICOM berth for Stuttgart, Germany wia e go maintain oda combatant command, since dey don close world war II
But honestly we must admit say thins don turn away for awa armed force for di last 10 years
Di fight against Boko Haram armed insurgent don run inside quagmire
no be only dat one but oda form of insurgency  don crop up for di form of wholesale to dey flourish kidnappin industry and oda form of bandit
nobodi fi don dey able to accurately pinpoint why di fight against di Boko Haram insurgents wey plenti consider as ragtag assemblage, don confound awa armed force
we think say awa force don lack material and di whole nation raise for unison to support di President wen dey want billions direct from Federation Account to buy arms
dey draw moni, dey spend am and maybe dey buy arm but condition merely deteriorate wit insurgency kom precarious kom dey spread across di nation
Governor Sani Bello tok plenti wen hin warn Boko Haram fighter don raise dia infamous flag for hin domain and dey walkin distance of Abuja. di Federal Capital
Mohammed Ali Ndume, wey be di senator wey dey represent Borno South don dey Evriwia for di media lately, dey decry say di deficits for di war effort
Senator Ndume suppose know, bikos hin be di chairman of di Senate Committee for di Army
Vibrant and Passionate, Ndume neva don dey dey short of  word advancin di kos of hin constituency wey dey presently besieged by Boko Haram insurgent
Hin gah put am plainly across say di entire arm force lack di of material to accomplish di myriad of assigment before dem
on top dat dey lack di number wey dey need
dat go maybe explain why despite dia pedigree, awa arm force dey bogged down by number of ragtag brigands
 To kom worse mata, di casualties dey raise by di day
Di glory statistics wey Samuel Aruwan, give few days ago, Kaduna state commissioner of internal Affairs and International Security, dem dey fear reach
Hin report say for three month between January and March 2021, bandit wey dey terrorise Kaduna State don kill 323 and don con abduct 949 citizen
I think say similar figure fit show up from neighbour wey dey Katsina, Niger and Zamfara State if dey kip  statistics
Time don kom for change of heart, maybe do wetin fit don dey unthinkable  some year ago
I dey hapi say dey don win di President for di argument
Dis one sho wella wen for one televised virtual meetin wit di US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken he specifically ask di US make dem reconsider relocatin the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) from Stuttgart go Africa so e go dey close to di theatre of operations and e go hep strengthen di ongoin efforts to check di security situation.
I see di exchange close and clear I see di President grimace wen hin kom to di point for hin speech wia hin ask di US to move AFRICOM  kom Africa
Na di kind surrender wey only Generals understand, as painful duty to save territory, fightin men and material

As access to fertiliser dimsa farmer devise means to dey generate manure from neem
As di hope to dey get goment subsidise fertiliser dis farmin season dim further, some farmer for Jigawa State don adopt di technique to dey turn neem leaves inside fertiliser
di farmers especially those for Maigatari Local goment Area say dem decide to shift attention towards usin local methods of enrichin dia soils for beta productivity as a result of di spike in di price of inorganic fertilizers
NPK fertiliser now bi costs over N12,000 per 50kg in di open markert, and di usually subsidised one by di federal goment which usually sold for N5,000 may not be feasible dis year
Di Minister of Agriculture, Mohammed Sabo Nanono, don tok say di federal, goment go, from dis year, hands off for buying and selling of fertiliser but go play a supervisory role
Plenti stakeholder don interprete di minister stand to mean goment witdrawal of fertiliser subsidy, so tey  farmers no get option dan to buy from di open market
as di rainy season don be for plenti part of di kontri, farmers dey forced to find manure by any means
Dis na di major reason wey make new innovertion dey among di Jigawa farmers
how farmers take use neem leaves for manure
neem leaves wey fall from di tree dey heep by di farmers dem kom put for inside gutters and drains kom leave am to decompose
One of di farmers tok say dem dey dry di decomposed leaves before dem finally take am go farm
Many farmers wey dey for town agree as although di practice kos blockage of dia drains, e get beta impact for dia soil
Mallam Imrana Adamu, one farmer for Maigatari tok say him don dey into di practice for some time now and him dey satisfied wit di way di compost dey help am maintain di fertility for him soil
But unlike some farmers for di town wey use drains dey carryout di process, Mallam Imrana tok say him use him side dey decompose di organic fertiliser
Him tok say, mix di dry neem leaves wit ash, con sprinkle water put for di mixture con allow di process take hin course
I fit assure you say e dey veri effective for di enrichin of di soil
I don dey practice am dey see positive result, I still dey pracrtice am
On top di efficacy and effectiveness of dis practice, Dr Yunusa Muhammed Shuaibu, lecturer for di Department of Crop Production, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Bauchi, tok say di practice na form of decompostin wey speed up mineralisation con enrich di soil as e dey supply nutrients like phosporus wit calcium to am

Di operation of political parties for democracy na systematic, flexible and elastic wen dem compare am wit political parties outside democracy
Howeva, political parties for democratic state dey distinctive wit dose for non-democartic states, especially for dia mode of operations
Sometimes, dem share partial similarities and roles
Yet, di roles for dose wey dey democracy no dey distinguishable from to advocate transparency, accountability, integrity wit quality of choosing representatives for favour of national interest
Nevadiless, for Nigeria, Buhari na di president and commander-in-chief for di army forces.
Him been go through rigorous democratic political parti process before him go emerge victorious for pre-primary, primary and post primary elections
As member of political parti, him be like any oda member and possess no legal proceedin use influence di servin governor, servin senator and member house of reps for under di impression of di same political parti for democracy as far as say good governance na di mata of di day
Dis gats do wit parti political exercise for rulin ova di affairs of hin members wen di need kom
Contrastingly, Buhari participation for decision to make hin minimal compare to di late by Chad bikos of dia policital system differences and leadership modus operandi
Buhari dey less sensitive for governance, hin dey less powerful over some national affairs and hin dey effective legislatively
No be like by pesin wey dey sensitive, wey dey powerful and wey dey strong bikos of hin non democratic identity and policitical ideology
make we say, di edge of governance for Chad na e dey say e get sef center feature witout collective effort wey di pipo make wey dem dey rule
In fact, di system allow larger portion of corruption and manipulation of single interest, meanwhile silencin di voice of dia member durin policital tok, public opinion and to dey make decision
for di sake of democracy, and sense  of nationalism for Nigeria, no one fi or go personally decide to do wetin anythin between executive, legislature and judiciary
no mata how patriotic di persin fit be
one most act accordin to di constitutional guideline as well as to dey pass hin idea to di three tiers of goment for critique, suggestion and support
for example, if Buhari dey eager to kpeme for di battlefield, hin must first identify di legality of sacrificin hin life constitutionally as President of Nigeria wey wan fight Boko Haram in favor of national interest
Hin must understand say hin ability politically and democratically before hin go pay di price
Anyway, Nigeria no be Chad, for here we dey operate democracy no be military and dictatorship
for Chad, by say dem adopt political parti for unitary system of goment wey dey link to dictatorship
By di way, di system wey hin enjoy delibrately lack  check and balance if dey compare wit di bicameral legislature
If you fit remember, di Dbys political party na Patriotic Salvation Movement; di party dey built on spirit of nationalism and di aim na to produce patriotic mindsets wit sophisticated ideology and spiritual high sense of nationalism.
wetin dey surprise
by di one wan remain and hin answer di clarion call of hin parti MPS
True nationalist for tru tru

Na undisputed fact say for di history part wey plenti pass, women neva enjoy equal right
Na only sevaal decades wey don pass, di general belief wey dey surround women role dey restricted to duties for house, to dey born pikin and to dey work for kitchen
Dis perception bring plenti amount of disregard and prejudice against women, no be only for di family and community level, but glarin misrepresentation and stereotypical portrayals for mainstreal media
Pass all, dey no allow women to dey make important decision makin, leadership position, access to high education and professional aspiration
Make we say one of di notable shifts for di movement for woman right na di Women Strike for Equality for August 26, 1970
Di strike wey take place for di United State to celebrate di 50th anniversary of di passin of di 19th Amendment, wey effectively give women for America di right to vote

For Nigeria, gender inequality don heavily pervaded society
Woman carry like 49:33 per cent of di Nigeria population, wey dey approximate to 99.13 million for total
Howeva, female participation for formal and informal structure, get and kom carry key decision makin remain insignificant
Dis dey largely bikos of discriminatory social norms, marginalization and economic disparity, wey dictate di live of women for Nigeria

On March 1, 2021, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, wey be one Nigeria political figure and economist, bikom di first woman and first African wey go serve as di Director-General of di World Trade Organization, na landmark achievement for women and Africans evriwer for di world.
Di victory,and plenti oda, don bikom clear sign say female empowerment, eqality, and leadership dey necessary to foster positive change for society
we need all hand for deck to close gender gap
We don make great progress for gender equality and we no fit allow ham make e erod
we need act now to ensure say wen we continue to dey respond to di health and economic crisis, we go kom find way to progress women economic empowerment and equality, for education, for house and for workplace

We need new, radical collaboration wey fi focus on di financial source, but make dem bring all awa partners for di start
make we  look 70s, 80s and even large part of di 90s, we fit tok am as say na significant improvement to dey reduce gender inequality for Nigeria, no delay  we still dey for back
Wen you luk di 17 action points of di Development Goals wey dey fit sustain, wey be di global roadmap wey you fit understand pass to shared human progress,e dey impossible to overlook di centrality of hin call for gender equality and to dey reduce inequalities.
Indeed,E no dey probable say di world fit reach significant success for almost any action area of SDGs “ as dem dey ensure quality health care, education and sanitation for evribodi to reduce poverty, end hunger, provide productive employment or enable strong institutions “ witout say dem achieve wella for gender equality and dey reduce inequalities.

Issue dem wey FG must fix to regain glory inside cotton matta
For di last two years, di production of cotton don dey gather momentum, but dem neva solve di challenge wey farmer dem dey face.
Farmer wey dey farm cotton mostly na smallholders, and production na largely through rain-fed system, using traditional farm tools and animal traction (animal drawn implements).
However, few don get access to tractor. 
For late 1980s, e reach 900,000 smallholder dem wey dey grow cotton, den hold average of 0.5 to 1.5 hectare for di total area wey dem estimate as 700,000 hectare across di kontri.
However, as di textile and garment industry don collapse, plus poor market, most of di farmer dem abandon production enter oda crop dem wey get better market.
Current production level
Dem estimate di annual demand of cotton for Nigeari at 88,000 metric tonnes of lint, wey reach 225,000 metric tonnes of seed cotton.
Until 2019, di total domestic production dey below 60,000 as plenty farmer dem dey struggle to achieve di average yield of between 400kg and 750kg of seed cotton per hectare despite di fact say some of di field prospect of about 2.5 to 3.0 metric tonne per hectare.
Statistics from di National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NACOTAN) show say di nomba of farmer dem under di association don grow from 90,000 for 2018 reach 134,000 farmer dem for di 2020 wet season.
For 2019, di farmers dem achieve 120,000 to 130,000 tonnes, wey amount reach increase of about 80,000 metric tonnes. 
For inside dis 2020 wet season, dem expekt make production reach 200,000 metric tones, accordinto NACOTAN.
Di current market
A farmer, Bala Sarkin Ruwa for Shelleng, inside Adamawa State, tell Daily Trust on Sunday say e sell di two ton of im cotton early for 180,000.
But im counterpart, Mr Joshua Dadi tok say he sell for N200,000 for January 2021, he describe di price say e fair.
Mr Anibe Achimugu, national president of di NACOTAN and managing director for ARewa Cotton describe di current price say e good for farmer dem, if dem compare to previous one.
For 2019, di price for one tonne be N205,000 for farmer dem. 
Dat one mean say one farmer be dey do over 100,000 profit directly into di pocket if e dey able to poduce 2 tonnes of seed cotton.
Di intervention an such say di Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) wan jump start di sector.
And of course, you wan leave am, to large extend, for market-driven price dem and demand.
Now, di minimum price, at least for dis year, na N185,000 per metric tonne, wey still better pass make dem leave am on im ownand e no go encourage farmer dem, and so on, wia price dem be N150,000 per metric tonne.
I thingk say di minimum price wey dem guarantee since di intervention be don dey good, as e tok am.

Professor Ishiyaku Mohammed, the executive director for di Institute of Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, tok say di institute don release 13 different variants of cotton seed dem wey get veri important economic attribute dat increase di income of farmer and provide different product for utilisation, either as fibre or for making textile product dem, or to even to provide oil.
Di farmer dem tok say lats year, dem access to better seed wey get quality dey improved, wey get potential yirld of 2.5 tonne per hactareif dem follow di best agronomic practice.
With dat, Achimugu tok say a farmer be dey jump for yield figure between 400 to 500 kilogram per hectare to 1.2, 1.5 and in fact, some be dey get reach 2.5 tonne per hectare.
You know say na how well you take manage your farm, di dedication plus skil wey you get, but i go tell you specifically say di lowest wey we record na around 700 to 750kg per hectare.
But farmer dem be dey hit 1.5 to 2.5 tonnes per hectare, e dey fantastic.
For 2018, di gederal goment, through di National Varietal Release and Naming Committee, be approve commercialisation of two transgenetic variety of cotton, MRC 7377 BG 11 and MRC 7361 BG II wey Mahyco Nigeria Private Ltd develop, as dem collabo wit di Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) in di Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.
To resuscitate cotton industry, a lifeline
Cotton na key component for di textile and garment industry dem bikos e dey provide fibre to take manufacture textile product dem.
However, di faith wey di taxtile industry get for inside di nation don go down to pulp for decade since di glorious years.
For di 1970s and di 1980s, di Nigeria textile industry be account for about 25 per cent of di manufacturing value added (MVA).
Na be largest employer of labour (e pass  600,000 people during the 1970s to 1980s) for di manufacturing sector afta public sector for di early 1990s.
However, expert don see di collapse of di textile industry wey turn Kaduna to household name for di kontri as high operating cost, wey dey result from poor energy supply, decay of infrastructure and proliferation of di market with textile dem wey cheap and di one wey dem smuggle.
Dem also force some to relocate go oda kontri dem withing di sub-region.
Among di 54 ginneries wey dey avilable for Nigeria, Only 22 dey function for very low capacity utilisation.
Di ginning capacity for di ginneries wey dey exist na about 650,000 tonnes of seed cotton but national production dey fall to less than 60,000 tonnes per year wey dey represent about 10 per cent capacity utilisation accordin by di data from di Raw Material Research and Development Council (RMRDC).
Dis trend get spirally limiting effekt on top di cotton value chain development localy, na im add to take kos make plenty textile industry (83) fold up between 1995 reach now, as di few wey dey function dey perform for low capacity utilisation, as Professor Hassaini Ibrahim Doko, the director-general, RMRDC tok.
Expert tok say to bring cotton value chain back to life and im glorious day dem, di federal goment must to champion di revival of industry dem wit many many policy dem and financial intervention.
FG must to tackle smuggling, cheap import
Di Director-General for di Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association, Alhaji Hamma Kwajaffa, tok say smuggling plus cheap Chinese product na di probblem for cotton industry inside di kontri.
Despite say procurement act dey say make dem dey look for local content first, nothingg don change much as plenty inside di material wey dem dey use for uniform dey kom from China, as oda dem dey kom from China, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Di original thing suppose be say we dey source all awa uniform locally from di textile kompany dem.
If you look awa school dem, Army, Navy, Air Force, Immigration, Customs etc, if dem dey source dem uniform locally, of kos many of di textile industry no for close.
Smuggling na awa actual problem.
You know say dealer fit go China; and for China, anything wey you ask for, dem fit do am for you.
Dem dey go China wit awa textile design and di Chinese go do am for dem as dem take want am, and dis go end up for market inside Nigeria, Alhaji  Kwajaffa lament.
Cotton farmer, through NACOTAN want make federal goment take cotton up as national asset and make dem introduce Nigeria standard, wey fit help di kontri get better gradin system, as well as to establish laboratory wey dem go take dey test cotton wit high volume instrument, e also tok say na dis one go take care of di issue dem.
Bandit dem affect production.
For di last two years, plenty cotton farmer dem no fit reach dem farm, bikos of di things wey bandit dem dey do along major production area dem.
E neva tey, wey di only textile company wey dey survive for inside Kaduna State be shut down operation and dem sack pass 100 staff bikos say raw material no dey as di farmer dem dey complain say bandit dem no allow dem reach farm. 
Stakeholder dem tok say make goment ginger dem security architecture make farmer dem fit return to dem farm as dat one na di only way to take reduce poverty for rural community dem.
Abdullahi Salisu Dayi, farmer for  inside Malumfashi Local Goment, tok say unless some wey dey spectacular apun to take favour di production of cotton, e doubt am if farmer dem go wan do am as dem do last year.
Climate change wey dey affect production 
Last year, many cotton farmer for inside Katsina, Gombe and Adamawa state dem be suffer erratic rainfall, wey do affect yield.
Some farmer dem wey speak wit Daily Trust on Sunday for Adamawa, Katsina and Gombe tok say heavy rainfall be affect dem yield welwel.
Joshua Dadi for Kem, Adamawa State, tok say im yield dey affected bikos say rain stop suddenly.
Although he get 4 tonnes for im two-hectare farm, di yield no reach di yield of 2019.
Hamisu Sani for Katsina tok say cotton farmer dem suffer most as di demand for di produce no be like as e be for rice, maize or soybeans, yet di price dey good for N200,000 per tonne.
He add say plenty rain wey fall be enter awa farm and e stop di crop to grow, and e also make di cotton ball make dem rotten for early stage.
Anoda farmer wey dey grow cotton for large scale, Alhaji Kamilu Kankara, tok say im also suffer low yield of di produce bikos say rain fall plenty.
Over di years, demand wey dey on top food don prompt make I withdraw gradually from massive cotton production.
E be like say na dis year worst pass for me as I harvest only nine bags from inside two hectare wey be dey give three tonnes of cotton, as e take tok am.
With population wey don grow pass 200 million and army of youth wey no get job wey dey waka for street, expert dem be tok make goment give priority to sector like agriculture big attention, both for budget, policies and financial intervention dem.
Farmers Cocoa production no dey progress for Edo
Cocoa farmer dem for inside Edo State don lament say lack of support from di state and federal goment dey hinder cocoa production for inside di state.
Di state chairman of di assocition, Thomas Ekpenriebe, be state dis for Benin wen im dey follow journalist tok on top di prospect of cocoa farming for di state.
He tok say di farmer dem neva get any support from either di state goment or di Federal goment, like input and funding, e tok say di development be dey affect cocoa production for di state.
As e dey now for Edo, we dey Ibadan and Ondo State to get new hybrid cocoa bikos di cocoa seed garden for inside di state no dey function, and nobody dey mange am.
Also, extension service no dey for cocoa farmer dem for di state.
For di 1960s, cocoa na im be di cash crop wey dem use to develop di kontri.
Today, nothing dey kom from di state or federal goment.
We just dey work on awa own and e dey affect cocoa production for di state and di kontri in general, as e take tok.
Di farmer dem call for support from di Edo State Goment to invest put for cocoa farming by make dem wake di extension service again, make dem re-establish cocoa seed garden to take avoid travel to oda state dem for seed and also to take generate more money for di state.
Di chairman be also lament about di acitivity of middlemen dem inside cocoa business for di state, wey im tok say dey affekt di profit wey dey on top cocoa.
When im dey call say make dem re-establish cocoa board all over di kontri, di board go serve as regulatory bodi wey go help cocoa farmer dem to know buyer wey get license and regulate price for di commodity.
He explain say currently, na Edo State get di best quality cocoa due to di concerned effort by stakeholder dem.
Ekpenriebe also point finger for climate wey no dey favour, COVID-19 plus say regulatory bodi no dey as major block for di sector.
Development on top entrepreneurship: Purpose and mindset
Afta colonial master dem arrive enter various part of wetin later bekom Nigeria, and di begining of introduction of Western-style administration, di need to train native oublic servant start.
As need for various service dey increase, di vacancy dem for trained manpower kontinu to dey plenty for many decadego reach di 1980s.
But for late 1980s, we don begin not to just dey saturate di public service dem, but be like dem don employ too much.
If any realistic and prudent thing go apun to awa public service dem ova di next one decade, e go be delibrate and systemic rightsizing, and dat na di polite way to say downsizing except for di military, di police and oda such service dem. 
Yes, obviously, pipo go die or make dem retire and need go dey to employ for replacement and for some kind marginal growth too.
But di vacancies combined no dey likely to meet up wit di rate graduates from high school and university dey komot from all around di kontri.
We have to, therefore, no be to accept di reality say di public sector neva suppose dey dere to just to employ graduates alone but also to gladly accept di truism say di public sector suppose, instead, focus on to develop di enabling environment wey go see to di creation and growth of business of all size dem for all sector and crany of di kontri.
If you ask me, successive federal goment dem for di past don do well to take encourage graduates to enter sef-develoment and business through program dem wit di Bank of Agriculture, Bank of Industry, SMEDAN, NDE, NIRSAL, etc.
But di call neva dey sufficiently loud and equivocal: Di goment must cease to dey create any impression say e fit employ di plenty youth , make dem honest and communicate clearly say employment opportunity dem dey limited for di public sector wey fit dey komot from time to time. 
Instead, make di goment kontinu dey focus on top to streghten di various interventionist and enabling program dem wey go facilitate di creation of employmeny by youth demsef.
Obviously, all di program wey we donmention before fit only succeed and dem go dey sustainable if dem put a sense of responsibility of accountability for inside pou youth.
Wit population wey pass two hundred million pipo and e still dey grow, more than sufficient local market dem dey for plenty product and service dem.
From abundant land wey dey fertile for agriculture all across di kontri, reach solid minerals inside most state of di federation; information technology, manufacturing and services, we be plenty opportunity for entrepreneurs wey seriuos.
Ova weeks wey dey kom, dis column go try to bring out topical issue on top entrepreneurship wey go help awa youth to understand opportunities amd how to take seize dem and create jib for demsef and odas.
Di starting point for any and evri endeavour wey dey worthy in life na two: purpose and mind-set.
One of di reason wey plenty pipo fail to achieve maeningful and sustainable success for inside business and life na bikos dem fail to identify di purpose of dem life from di begining.
 Even when dem fit boast of wetin be like outward achievement wey dey reasonable, dem fit still lack di internal satisfaction wey dey neccessary to kip dem motivated and going for di marathon wey dis life be.
Na lack of purpose be dey make us loss resources like awa time, money, effir dem, relationship, etc.
For di long run, we realise say e don deprive us of true meaning for di various sphere of awa lives and di cintentment wey go follow am kom.
Without any purpose or wit a weak one, e dey easy for pesin to sway komot form dem noble journey.
Entrepreneurship dey particularly challenging
If clear purpose wey get deep meaning wey dem internalise, you risk to miss your way or to give up when you hit headwinds, and plenty of am go dey for di journey!
Di next thing wey dey most important afta purpose na your mindset.
Either we know abi we no know, evrithing dey start wit awa mindset.
Successful entrepreneurs have an amazing perception of what dey want to achieve years and even decades before it becomes reality. Entrepreneur dem wey dey successful get perception wey dey amazing on top di thing wey dem wan achieve years and decades even before e go bekom reality.
Na di clearity of di vision wey dey dem mind dey kip motivation for dem inside and dem no dey show say dem tire outside.
And so e be like say nothing fit stop dem. 
For di conceptual development and production of di Snow White and di Seven Dwarfs, DI America pesin Walt Disney be face resistance wey no dey believable from financier dem, contributor and oda associate dem, include im broda, Roy Disney.
Gossip pipo for inside Hollywood dey call di project say na Disney's Folly.
But Disney dey very clear for im mind on top wetin im be wan achieve.
Im no gree to make im focus komot for di outkom wey im desire.
For di end, di projekt be cost whopping 1.5 million US dollars of 1938.
But for di first weekend wey dem release am, Snow White bring $8 million, wey be like $134 million for current dollar!
Dis level for confidnece neva no fit be by accident.
Na consequence of mindset wey don commit say e go achieve some goal dem wey dem don identify.
Ask any entrepreneur wey don dey successful, dem go gree wit dis tori on top vision, mindset and resolve.
Wit clear purpose and mindset wey dey committed, di nect thing wey budding entrepreneur need to aware about na what dem go expekt for entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurship: Wetin you must expect for inside di journey go dey dis column next week.
Musbahu El Yakub na author, business consultant and entrepreneur.
Senator for inside Niger want make dem compulsory electric votin for 2023 election
Di Senator wey dey represent Niger East Senatorial District, Mohammed Sani Musa, don advocate compulsory use of electronic voting durin di 2023 general election dem.
As e dey follow news pipo tok on Monday for inside Abuja, Senator Musa tok say electronic voting go increase participation for election as e go allow make voter dem vote from anywia.
Di lawmaker therefore dey urge di Committee inside Senate wey concern  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) wey dey do work on top amendment of Electoral Act 2010, to include make dem compulsory di use electronic voting for inside dem final report to di senate at plenary.
Senate President Ahmad Lawan don tok say di National Assembly go pass di amendment of di bill before di summer recess wey be June. 
Electronic voting go increase di level wey pipo dey take participate bikos e go allow make dem vote for anywia.
E tok say e go also komot violence bikos di majoruty of pipo wey fit access di internet go prefer make dem vote for dem house or office dem instead make dem go polling station wey armed thug dem fit kos havoc.
Grazing wahala: why make state dem follow Zamfara template
Kwagga Dlama Zira Eliphelet na architect, designer and projekt manager for di Zamfara Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) projekt.
For dis interview wit Daily Trust on Sunday, he tok say dem fit use di model of Zamfara to take solve di crisis between herders and farmers across di kontri. 
Im opinion na say di best way to take implement di template na base on di peculiarity of each state, wit di overall interest of creating peace, jobs and economic opportunities.
Crisis dey di livestock sector for Nigeria, especially for di area of animal feeds.
Plenty stakeholder dey suggest say one of di to move forward na to create ranches for herders to take tame grazing crisis wit farmer dem.
As expert for dis area, to what extent you thingk say dis fit help?
Di farmer-herders crisis wey don kontinu to dey apun don chop enter di fabric of dis nation and e follow join di division wey we dey experience.
As matter of fact, ranching na di solution for dis problem bikos for evri well meaning Nigerian, RUGA, wey stand for rural grazing area, don dey wit us since 1946, but e be don dey dormant.
For inside 21st century, di best way to take float production for di livestock system na to get farm or ranches for full commercial production.
Open grazing and to dey travel kilometre don komot for date for inside evri strata of humanity today.
So dis one na opportunity for us to tap awa potential for inside agriculture, wey we don forget.
Di RUGA template wey suppose adopt dey unique and peculiar.
State dem dey wey no fit get RUGA or ranch dem, but dem get di potential o take benefit for big capacity, concerning livestock production.
Di farmer need to produce wetin di herder go use as raw material, just as di cow dung be manure for di farmer.
Make dem no force di RUGA on all state dem, but each state fit take advantage of am, base on im own peculiarity.
If di state dem wey dey for far north buld ranches, i expekt say make southern state wey fit get RUGA take advantage of am make dem put up large scale fodder of pasture production farming, wey go sweep plenty of awa teeming youth komot for di street dem.
Dis one na opportunity for governor dem and commissioner of agriculture dem to look inside how we fit tap dis potential dem.
 We no suppose see RUGA as program wey go kos division.
Wen di federal goment be moot di idea of national livestock program, some state, especially di south, say no to am, as dem tok say na way to take kolekt dem land give herders.
As expert wey you be, you fit torchlight how dem fit resolve am?
Di pipo wey dey sell di president no fit sell di idea welwel bikos, as a matter of fact, di issue of RUGA setllement no be to take kolekt land.
You no fit go inside Adamawa to kolekt pesin land, even if dem don mix with Fulani.
E no dey work like dat.
You go at peculiarity wey each state get to take decide if you fit establish settlement or not.
So make di president and im cabinet look inward and inside di peculiarity of each state.
Na why e be say today, despite na di main program of di president, dem neva still see am do.
Dis na bikos dem dey do am as say na di whole kontri.
Plenty goment farm dem dey wey dem don abbandon; dis na opportunity to take use dem.
Let us kom togeda to take negotiate dis project again and you go see say pipo go adopt di roadmap.
Make us make we get policy wey fit work for all of us, plus make di purpose dey sincere.
Make proper dialogue dey between state dem wey dey fit for dis project, and dis one go put harmony for di relationship wey we share.
Fear dem dey say e go difficult for di tradtional Fulani to stay inside ranch, how dem go attend to dat one? No be to stay inside ranch.
Just as indigenous pipo for oda part of di kontri dey reject dis bikos dem neva give dem sense of belonging to di project, na di same wit some indigenous Fulani wey no fit move bikos dem don internarry.
Fulani dey wey dey live for there.
For instance, inside Adamawa, some dey wey dey stay for one place, and dem fit show diffence for di ones wey dey do season movement dem.
So dem also fit adopt di system of say make dem dey oneplace if dem give proper orientation to dem.
Wetin I dey try tok be say make we find way to take stop di upward and downward movement.
Nobody go dispute di fact say fattening na when you kip cattle for one place.
Dis concept no be to imprison di herder but to provide new opportunity dem.
Zamfara na one of di state dem wey dey pilot RUGA, and you be key stakeholder for di project; wetin be di solution now?
Di project na bargaining chip for peace, so make economy for thrive.
When we be start work, dem tell us say before Governor Matawalle be enter office, di rate of bandits make di no dey accessible, but im dey able to bring peace.
Dis one no suppose apply for herder dem alone.
How we go take harness and build awa own farming community dem?
Which oda essential amenity and infrastructure dem we need to carry give awa farming community?
Shey na very good rural road go bring all di grass dem make dem kom out.
Shey na good canal dem wey go carry water reach wia di stream dem no reach, abi na borehole for interval to give good water, primary health care?
Some kind basic thing dey wey dem need to provide. 
But na right of di citizen and e no suppose be priviledge. 
Specifically, wetin you get inside di Zamfara RUGA project?
Di RUGA model get 23 item dem.
We get di road network, wey reach about 13.673 kilometres.
Di ranch dey for di Ranji Sakida Grazing Reserve inside Maradun Local Goment Area; and na 2,218 hectares.
Di plot phase be start wit about 100 hectare dem, but due to natural formation, e take about 300 hectare dem.
Dat one na for house and oda structure dem, but we expekt say make e take almost di whole place bikos of pasture production.
Oda reserve dey wey dem do for similar project dem, like Zumi Gidan Jaja wey reach about 36,200 hectare dem and di Dantsado Kuyanbana forest of about 10,000 hectare dem.
On top di pilot phase, di state goment be buy one pivot sprinkle system, wey get about 850 meter for diameter and radius wey reach 475.
Apart from di road dem, we get water reticulation, wey dey serve about 27 kilometre dem.
Water storage facility dey, four overhead plus four surface tank, each of dem dey carry 250,000 litre, all togeda go give you 2million litre dem.
Den we get industrial borehole wey solar dey power, wey dem 8 to each one.
We get 10 borehole wey dem don use hand sink.
As at December, di reticulation don almost reach 18 kilometres, for inside 27.
We also get health facility dem, wey include one primary health care with 30-bed capacity and theartre dem, outdoor patient department, one nursery to take deliver, dem attach am to di maternity. 
We no dey expekt case wey pass di capacity of di health care.
Veterinary clinic dey, wey get capacity to accommodate reach 1,000 withing im own confines.
And e get im own thaetre and isolation room dem, e include 12 paddocks.
Market dem dey wit open and close stalls and abbattoir dem.
But for di context of Fulani man, he no dey kill im animal for im environment, so e go carry am go far to kill, so di abattoir dey outside di ranch.
Na Maradun town di abattoir go dey.
We get 210 plot dem for herders, each measure reach 2,475 square meter, and dem divide to four.
Na six hundred square meter dem give for area wey dem go live make di herder fit build im hut di way he want am.
Dem divide di three wey reamin, fence and denarcate dem, each paddock get gate.
We provide squat system for dem and soak-away for each house.
For inside di 210  plot wey dey, five bedroom dem dey for Fulani or Hausa leader dem.
Two bedroom dem dey for ward head dem.
Religion facility dem dey: one eid ground, one central mosques and space wey dey outdoor wey fit take reach 1,000 pipo dem.
Also one Islamiyya dey attached to di mosque, plus one school, so dem fit get opportunity of Islamic and western education.
Oda space dem dey for future development.
Wetin be di economic benefit of di settlement for future time?
We get phase one and two.
Phase one na to provide di basic amenity dem to bring di herder dem back into cluster.
Di economic benefit be say e go attract investor dem all ova di world.
E go bring di production of meat, wey go later provide revenue.
E go open job opportunity for veterinary doctor dem, agricultural extension worker dem, company wey fit kom dey do milk, cheese nd manure production, bio gas, bone processing, hide and skin processing, animal feed for di blood, to combine am wit oda ingredients, then pasture production from farmer dem.
Di $250m fundin wey dem plan for national acrrier dey unsetle operator dem
One projection by federal goment to raise $250 million for di national carrier wey dem propose don dey make operator dem dey ask question for inside di aviation industry, as Daily Trust report am.
According to one document weu aviation ministry release last week, di federal goment expect make private investor dem raise $250m for di carrier wey dem dey propose as dem insist say dem go deliver di project before 2023 kom.
For inside di document wey give update on top di national carrier project and oda sub-project inside di roadmap, di Ministry of Aviation explain say dem don complete di  project development phase. 
Di goment explain say di next phase go be di placement of Request for Qualification (RFQ) for local and international media.
$250m approximately na im private investor  go raise to take start up airline
But stakeholder doubt di feasibility of di project, dem tok say investor fit no get will to put dem money for such venture.  
Rather, some of dem call on di goment to harvest di facility of di airline under dem management to set up di national carrier.
Di Managing Director, Flight and Logistics Solution, Amos Akpan tok say e go be big task for private investor dem $250m to take establish national airline.
He attribute di difficulty to plenty oda factor like return on top investment (ROI), business environment, and oda dem.
He tok say, to take position to attract investment dey more critical for now.
If di gestation of investment run enter di next goment wey dey kom for 2023, shey e go affect di agreement wey dem don establish wit dis goment?
Nigerians dem still dey experience discriminatory aircraft leasing agreement and insurance program dem.
We still dey try to effect di implementation of no duty on top aircraft spare part dem.
Di forex regime neva accommodate airline operator dem.
Interlining and cooperation still dey di  concept stage. 
Make we fix di platform or foundation first before we go fit build or launch on top am.
For im remark, aviotion analyst and Head of Research Zenith Travel, Olumide Ohunayo, state say no amount too small for national carrier if high credibility dey and contact with lessors, aircraft manufacturers and oda airline dem.
Group captain John Ojikutu (rtd), wey be aviation analyst, wonder wetin $250m go do for di project and di would-be investor dem.
Private investor dem go include foreign and local; how much be $250m for national carrier or how many aircraft dat one go buy?
How much di goment investment of 10% go be inside nationa carrier?
If we want national carrier make am now
or make we beta go for flag carrier and di goment go take rest from di journey wey im start for 1993 wen di national carrier bekom goment airline.  
But anoda analyst, Mr. Chris Aligbe, tok say to raise $250m for di project no go dey difficult, e note say many investor dem dey and dem dey will to put dem money on top di project. 
According to am, di $250m go dey more than enough to start di project depending on di strategy wey dem dey adopt. 
Di captain of Leicester flapp for one corner to punch di ball into im own net as e remain 14 minute make time end. 
With as di home side dey take chase winner, Bale be strike twice for inside di final 10 minute to also take im end im loan spell for Real Madrid on a high.
